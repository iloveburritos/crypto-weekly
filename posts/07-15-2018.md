The researchers examined 2,390 ICOs and looked at the startups’ Twitter accounts to infer signs of life.

\- Coinbase announced it is exploring the addition of Cardano (ADA), Basic Attention Token (BAT), Stellar Lumens (XLM), Zcash (ZEC), and 0x (ZRX) to its platform. BAT and ZRX would be the first ERC20 based tokens added to the platform. [Link](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-exploring-cardano-basic-attention-token-stellar-zcash-and-0x-9e44f0eb823f).

\- Palladium, a Malta-based blockchain company, launched the world’s first fully regulated Initial Convertible Coin Offering (ICCO). An ICCO is essentially a tokenized convertible warrant that gives investors the right to convert the tokens into shares of Palladium three years after the issue date. Palladium has a fundraising target of 150 million which will go towards building an exchange and purchasing a controlling interest in a European bank.

\- CBOE, the world's largest futures exchange, filed for a Bitcoin ETF with the SEC. The filing states that CBOE would invest in bitcoin for its customers and coordinate OTC trades. Last year the SEC cited lack of regulations and price manipulation to reject an ETF request from Gemini (the exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins).

\- Dirt Protocol raises $3 million to create a protocol for crowdsourcing trusted information, calling itself the “Wikipedia for structured data”. One key difference from Wiki though is that Dirt contributors need to stake tokens in order to contribute information, creating a platform that disincentives bad actors. Investors include General Catalyst, Greylock, Lightspeed, Pantera Capital, DCG, SV Angel, and Fred Ehrsam (cofounder of Coinbase).

\- MLB announces it is launching a crypto-based game where users can buy/sell/trade baseball avatars involving popular moments in baseball history.

Augur hopes to lower fees and open the betting market to everyone. [Link](http://fortune.com/2018/07/09/augur-coin-crypto-rep-vitalik-buterin/).

\- The Bank of Canada found that the number of people in Canada who held Bitcoin rose from 2.9% in late 2016 to 5% in late 2017.

\- Opera, the Android browser, adds a crypto wallet to its mobile browser. The system is currently in beta and allows users to store/receive/send crypto and ERC20 tokens in their browser. The wallet is secured with the phone’s biometric security or passcode. The feature could allow for micropayment in the browser and paves the way for similar features in other browsers.
