**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- The SEC officially approved 11 applications for bitcoin spot ETFs on Wednesday, with trading going live on Thursday. The approval was overshadowed by a false announcement the previous day when the SEC’s twitter account was compromised. The fake post caused bitcoin to spike to $48,000 then drop to $45,500. [Link](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/09/business/sec-x-hack-bitcoin.html). [Link](https://decrypt.co/212190/sec-twitter-account-hacked-sends-false-bitcoin-etfs-approved-tweet).

\- Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin suggested in a Reddit AMA that ethereum could easily increase transaction capacity by increasing its gas limit, the amount of gas that can fit in a single block, by 33%. [Link](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/01/11/ethereums-vitalik-buterin-proposes-gas-limit-increase/). [AMA](http://v/).   
  
\- Despite being the deciding vote in a 3-2 result to approve the bitcoin spot ETFs, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said the SEC “did not approve or endorse bitcoin”. Senator Elizabeth Warren slammed the SEC’s approval of the ETFs. [Link](https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/01/12/gary-gensler-sec-spot-bitcoin-etf-approvals-cnbc-interview/).
