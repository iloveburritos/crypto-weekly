**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- NFT collection World of Women signed with investor and music exec Guy Oseary to represent the project across TV, film, music, video games, and consumer projects. Oseary already manages Bored Ape Yacht Club's Yuga Labs. World of Women NFTs saw almost $10 million of trading volume on the news, up more than 1,100%. The floor price of the collection has risen from 5 ETH a week ago to almost 8 ETH today. [Link](https://decrypt.co/90379/world-of-women-ethereum-nfts-surge-bored-apes-hollywood). [Link](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/world-of-women-nfts-reese-witherspoon-1283724/).   
  
\- NFT volumes soared to over $1.5 billion for the week according to data analytics site CryptoSlam, driven largely by Meebits NFTs which saw $1.3B of volumes in the last 7 days. Trading volume may be artificially inflated due to the launch of an NFT platform called LooksRare, which wants to take on market leader OpenSea. [CryptoSlam data](https://www.cryptoslam.io/meebits/sales/summary/?month=2022-01). [Blog Post](https://docs.looksrare.org/blog/launch-post). LooksRare launched its LOOKS token, a token that was claimable by users who listed an NFT for sale on the marketplace. LooksRare charges a 2% fee on all trades (lower than OpenSea's 2.5%) which it then distributes to users who stake their LOOKs tokens. Volumes on LooksRare skyrocketed as users artificially pumped up volumes to increase their rewards for staking; many of the trades were suspected to be 'wash trading' or users selling between wallets at artificially inflated prices. Staking rewards on LooksRare are currently at 805% APR. [Link](https://decrypt.co/90317/ethereum-nft-market-looksrare-wash-trading).   
  
\- DeFi governance platform Bribe announced a $4 million seed round to build what it refers to as a Voter Extractable Value (VEV) protocol. Bribe plans to route value to governance token holders by enabling "bribes" -- payments in exchange for voting on proposals in a certain way. VEV emerged during the "Curve Wars" which represented an escalating battle for other protocols to accumulate and control Curve's CRV governance tokens, which can incentivize user deposits into specific trading pools. [Link](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/12/pay-to-play-governance-builds-steam-as-bribe-raises-4m/).   
  
\- Transactions on emerging layer 1 blockchain Fantom passed those on Avalanche. Fantom is currently offering DeFi users ~30-60% APR on stablecoins. [Link](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/07/fantom-transactions-surge-ahead-of-avalanche-as-defi-prospects-heat-up/).   
  
\- $DOGE soared 16% after Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla merch could be purchased with the memecoin. [Link](https://decrypt.co/90435/dogecoin-climbs-tesla-begins-accepting-doge-merchandise).   
  
\- SEC chairman Gary Gensler wouldn't respond to an interviewers question about whether Ethereum was a security. The SEC had previously said that it didn't consider Bitcoin to be a security, and in June 2018 former director of the SEC William Hinman had said that Ethereum had become "sufficiently decentralized" since its launch and therefore was not a security. [Link](https://decrypt.co/90109/sec-chair-gensler-question-ethereum-security).   
  
\- The House Energy and Commerce Oversight Subcommittee is holding a hearing on the environmental impact of blockchains and proof-of-work networks like Bitcoin on January 20. There are growing concerns over the rise of crypto mining in the US, which has become the largest source of Bitcoin's hash rate over the last year after China banned mining. [Link](https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-cleaning-up-cryptocurrency-the-energy-impacts-of-blockchains).   
  
\- A new LinkedIn report shows that postings related to "bitcoin," "blockchain", and "Ethereum" grew 395% between 2020 and 2021. Most common roles were for blockchain developers and engineers. [Link](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/linkedin-news_theworkshift-economy-labormarket-activity-6887062336839016450-67iT/).   
  
\- Bitcoin payment processor Strike launched in Argentina. Users can only send and receive money on Strike via USDT for the time being, but Strike plans to add support for Bitcoin soon. [Link](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/14/strike-app-wont-support-bitcoin-in-argentina/).   
  
\- The total supply of USDC on Ethereum passed rival's USDT (Tether) for the first time ever. USDC supply hit 39.92 billion, while USDT supply was at 39.82 billion. Total supply of USDT is higher than USDC across all blockchains though. USDC's recent growth has come from increased usage in DeFi on Ethereum. [Link](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/130342/usdc-supply-on-ethereum-surpasses-usdt-first-time).   
  
\- Visa and ConsenSys are partnering together to build new infrastructure to support the rollout of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Their new tech will be able to plug into existing payment modules, meaning companies will be able to integrate infrastructure to issue things like CBDC-linked payment cards or wallet credentials, and could provide an on-ramp for existing networks. [Link](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/129932/visa-and-consensys-team-up-on-cbdc-tech).   
  
\- Crypto hedge funds significantly outperformed in 2021, returning 214% on average compared to just over 10% for the average hedge fund, which was below the S&P 500's index return of 26.9%. [Link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-end-challenging-2021-223617204.html).   
  
\- Music NFT platform Royal delayed its mint to Jan 20 after the site crashed a minute into the original mint on Jan 11. The drop is for 760 music NFTs from rapper Nas.

[Link](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/130123/3lau-backed-platform-royal-crashes-during-first-music-nft-drop-mint-delayed).   
  
\- Fees.wtf, a site that lets crypto users see how much they've spent on Ethereum transaction fees, released an airdrop that didn't perform as expected. WTF tokens were allocated proportionally to wallets based on the amount of fees paid, as long as they met the minimum 0.05 ETH threshold. The team had failed to provide enough liquidity for WTF tokens on Uniswap, which led trading bots to game the system and cause the price of WTF to spike and crash dramatically within the first 5 minutes of trading. [Link](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/130350/a-look-at-the-fees-wtf-airdrop-and-what-went-wrong).
