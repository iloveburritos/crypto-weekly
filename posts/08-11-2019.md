#### **THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- Walmart applied for a patent to use a stablecoin for cheaper and faster transactions as well as loyalty features. In the patent application the company says it wants to create a coin that runs and records transactions on a blockchain, and overlay the transaction information with customer purchase history and savings. By using its own digital coin tied to a traditional fiat currency, Walmart could reduce the fees it is charged by payment networks like Visa and Mastercard. Walmart is at the forefront of adopting blockchain tech and is already using blockchain for tracking produce along its supply chain. [Link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-02/walmart-seeks-to-patent-a-way-for-using-digital-cryptocurrency).   
  
\- The People's Bank of China is rolling out its central bank digital currency (CBDC) after 5 years of research and development. The CBDC will employ a two-tier operational structure: the PBOC at the upper level and commercial banks at the second level. It's unclear how the currency will work within China's existing financial system, but economists believe the digital currency could curb illicit capital flows, tax evasion and money-laundering, while also giving PBOC more transparency to drive better monetary policy. [Link](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/tiny/chinas-central-bank-digital-currency-is-ready-after-5-years-of-development/).

BlockFi has seen its monthly revenue grow 10x since January, which correlates with the rebound in bitcoin's price. The company is beginning to add to its portfolio of financial services, most recently introducing a savings account that enables investors to earn interest on their assets. Other companies providing crypto-backed loans issued in fiat include CoinLoan, SALT lending, Nexo.io and Celsius Network. [Link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-06/thiel-backed-valar-leads-finance-round-for-crypto-startup).

Blockstream previously raised $90 million from investors including Khosla Ventures and Reid Hoffman. [Link](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/tiny/blockstream-launches-bitcoin-mining-facility-and-pool/).
