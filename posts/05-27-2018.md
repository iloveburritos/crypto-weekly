**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- TruStory, a platform for users to research and validate claims that people make online, raises $3 million in an attempt to crack down on cryptocurrency frauds. While the platform will initially begin with the crypto market and claims being made in white papers and websites, ultimately the goal is to become a source of truth for all types of professional and personal claims. Founder Preethi Kasireddy was previously at Andreessen Horowitz and Coinbase.

\- GDPR takes effect May 25 and European crypto companies are struggling to understand the implications. The blockchain could potentially store personal data – starting with one’s transaction history- and as such, could fall into the scope of GDPR. Some argue that blockchain allows users to control their personal data, and as such is in compliance with the spirit of GDPR.

\- MIT tested smart contracts on bitcoin’s lightning network, to show how the platform can be used to efficiently handle millions of transactions with high degrees of complexity.

\- The top 25 cryptocurrencies fell across the board, as bitcoin fell below $8,000 on May 22 for the first time since April 18. The only top-25 cryptocurrency to be up this week is TRON (creating a decentralized platform for content creators), which saw minor gains around positive news of its upcoming main net launch on May 31. The project also announced a partnership with vSport to develop a FIFA World Cup prediction platform which could have contributed to the gains.

Circle recently announced a $110 million round led by Bitmain at a valuation around $3 billion. The company is looking to compete with existing platforms like Square, Robinhood, and Coinbase that make it easy for users to buy/sell cryptocurrencies.

Bonus rewards points will be offered to Boxed customers who buy Dove soap, Planters nuts, Cheerios cereal, and a handful of other items.

\- Just weeks after announcing its partnership with Pornhub, verge (XVG) saw over 55 million XVG’s being stolen/lost to miners as attackers exploited vulnerable code within the verge protocol.

Walmart’s distributed delivery record blockchain would be updated as transactions occurred, allowing it to follow products through their entire life cycle.

By scanning a QR code, consumers will be able to obtain essential information about the wine, including winery details, grape variety, an 18-digit Chinese customs declaration number, and dates when a bottle was taken from storage and delivered for consumer purchase in Shanghai. A partner at VeChain commented, “The beauty of blockchain is that shoppers can see information about the whole life cycle of a bottle of wine from various sides, including vineyards, logistics, and retailers.” [Link](https://cointelegraph.com/news/shanghai-startup-to-use-blockchain-to-verify-wine-origin-fight-counterfeits).
