**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- The price of ETH hit new all-time highs, surpassing the previous high of $4,384 in May. [Link](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/122163/eth-price-soars-to-new-all-time-high).  
  
\- Shiba inu, the self-proclaimed dogecoin killer, had a meteoric rise in price this week, passing Dogecoin in terms of market cap. According to data analytics platform Nansen, addresses labeled as "smart money" bought up $160 million of $SHIB in the last week. The currency had gained notoriety earlier this year when Vitalik Buterin donated tokens valued at $1 billion to charity.

\- Facebook announced it was changing its name to Meta, a sign of its deepening metaverse ambitions. The company also said that its metaverse would support NFTs. [Link](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/28/facebooks-metaverse-will-support-nfts/). [Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOn2CZWnxxY).  
  
\- NFT marketplaces SuperRare, Zora, OpenSea, Rarible, Nifty Gateway, Foundation, and Manifold partnered together to create The Royalty Registry. This registry will make it much easier to support on-chain royalties for NFTs across platforms, something that has historically been difficult due to variations in on chain contracts across platform. The registry also makes it possible for contracts that didn't originally support on-chain royalties to add them. [Link](https://royaltyregistry.xyz/lookup).  
  
\- A project that was promoted as a fork of DeFi project OlympusDAO raised $60 million in a token sale, but the assets disappeared from the treasury overnight in what appears to have been a phishing attack or a rug pull. AnubisDAO was first announced on October 28 and had dog-themed branding. It didn't have a website, and instead promoted on Discord and Twitter. [Link](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/122529/crypto-fork-uses-dog-meme-to-raise-60-million-then-the-money-goes-missing). One of the project's backers later shared a screenshot of an email they received that appeared to be from a prominent crypto investor. The PDF file that was presented as an investment deck may have contained malware, that was able to access the crypto wallets controlling the funds. Two VC firms said they had received the same phishing email. The individuals behind the attack posted [this](https://twitter.com/mgnr_io/status/1454102614459748359/photo/1) message on Ethereum. [Link](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/122557/email-scams-are-catching-crypto-investors-offguard-and-stealing-millions).  
  
\- Alchemy, dubbed the AWS for blockchain, raised $250 million Series C at a $3.5 billion valuation in a round led by a16z. [Link](https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/aws-for-blockchain-alchemy-boost-valuation-to-3-5b-with-250m-raise/).  
  
\- Coinbase's mobile app hit number one on Apple's US App Store, making it the most downloaded iOS app in the US. [Link](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/122445/coinbase-hits-number-1-spot-apple-us-app-store).  
  
\- Adobe is creating tools that will allow people to see attribution for the creator of the NFT, in addition to who minted it. Adobe will use an open-source method of cryptographically signing the image with the creator's identity. [Link](https://www.theverge.com/22740442/adobe-scott-belsky-interview-nft-photoshop-blockchain-creator-economy).   
  
\- [CryptoPunk #9998](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/9998) was not sold for over $532 million this week. It appears the owner of the punk used a flash loan (a large loan used to perform some function, and then repaid all in the same transaction in the same block). Here the CryptoPunk owner took out a flash loan for more than $532 million, used the funds to purchase the CryptoPunk, and then sent the money back to the lender, all within the same transaction.

\- DeFi lending protocol Cream Finance was hacked for $130 million - the funds stolen were mostly in Cream LP tokens and other ERC-20 tokens. Cream has suffered flash loan attacks in its history, losing $37 million in February and another $18 million in August. [Link](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/27/cream-finance-exploited-in-flash-loan-attack-worth-over-100m/).

\- Robinhood’s revenue miss sent shares of the company down 10% after hours, below its IPO price. The company had $51 million in crypto transaction-based revenue, a 78% decline from the $233 million it made during the Q2. Dogecoinhad been responsible for 61% of all crypto-transaction revenue in Q2. The revenue miss raised concerns about the company's reliance on crypto trading.
