**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- North Korea is the in the early stages of developing its own cryptocurrency, which would be used to "avoid international sanctions and circumvent the US-dominated global financial system".

\- Wells Fargo is going to launch its own settlement service using distributed ledger technology, similar to JPMorgan's 'JPM Coin'. The planned service, dubbed "Wells Fargo Digital Cash", will allow the financial corporation to settle internal cross-border payments across its global network of corporate clients. The service will bring in operational efficiencies including real-time payment processing. The pilot project will launch next year  and is expected to work  with USD transfers initially, though eventually the plan is to add support for multiple currencies and the entire global WF branch network. [Link](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190917005340/en/Wells-Fargo-Pilot-Internal-Settlement-Service-Distributed).

\- Venezuela's president Nicolas Maduro is mandating that the oil-backed petro cryptocurrency must be used in funding an ongoing social housing initiative. The government  believes using the petro would allow private investors to finance the construction of social housing through the stock market. Maduro has been pushing to make the petro a major part  of the nation's economy; earlier this year  he ordered the petro be made available to the public by the nation’s top bank, and forced pensions to be paid in petros, despite there being limited ways to access the value of the token. Maduro has also attempted to persuade other nations to accept the metro as an alternative to the US dollar in the oil markets and for global trade. [Link](https://www.coindesk.com/venezuelas-maduro-mandates-petro-use-in-funding-of-social-housing-project).
