**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- A multi-billion dollar protocol imploded this week, causing a greater sell-off across cryptocurrencies more broadly. Terraform Labs is behind algorithmic stablecoin UST (Terra USD) and Luna (the governance token of the Terra ecosystem). UST had grown to >$18 billion market cap through its Anchor dApp, which offered supposedly stable yields of 20% on UST. UST is pegged to 1 US dollar.   
\- Beginning May 7th the UST peg briefly fell and saw a brief flight to safety as some users sold out of Anchor. Terra has significant holdings of Bitcoin on its balance sheet which it can use to maintain the $1 peg if needed. Through a series of market events, some market makers sold sizable BTC positions in the open market, causing a decline in price and further exacerbating the selling pressure on UST.   
\- Anchor saw its deposits cut in half from $14 billion before the weekend to ~$6 billion on Monday. Withdrawals from Terra caused the UST peg to fall below $0.70 before eventually recovering to $0.90. LUNA was down about 50%.   
\- Continued rumors caused even more buying pressure, and an inflationary mechanism that introduced massive LUNA supply into the market resulted in LUNA price crashing to $0 and UST falling to $0.15.
