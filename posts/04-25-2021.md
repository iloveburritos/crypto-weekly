**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- The founder of Thodex exchange, a crypto exchange based in Istanbul, reportedly froze trading on the exchange and left the country holding $2 billion in investors assets.

Thodex went dark after running a promotional campaign that sold Dogecoins at a quarter the price at which they were trading at on other exchanges. The exchange locked in those investments and didn't allow any users to sell or convert to other cryptos. [Link](https://news.yahoo.com/turkish-crypto-founder-vanishes-reported-145413270.html).
