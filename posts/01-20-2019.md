\- Blockchain startup Spring Labs is partnering with 16 lenders and fintech firms to test a system that would take on credit bureaus like Equifax. Currently, banks give credit bureaus their customer information for free and then buy it back, as they cannot do credit checks themselves under current regulatory and competition frameworks. Thus, banks need a third-party to grant loans. Spring Labs' system would enable banks to cut out the middleman by verifying clients identities for themselves through an anonymous, decentralized ledger. Spring Labs believes this system will reduce fraud and replace outdated underwriting models like the credit score.
