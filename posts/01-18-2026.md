This week's big news: Coinbase withdrew support for the Digital Assets Market Clarity Act (CLARITY), citing concerns over restrictions on stablecoin yields for depositors. The move derailed a Thursday vote on the bill, which would have created a regulatory framework for crypto. Other industry leaders including Robinhood and Galaxy Digital voiced support for the draft bill.
