**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**
\- Crypto exchange Coinbase announces a new $300 million round of funding

valuing it at over $8 billion. The round was led by Tiger Global with
participation from Y Combinator, Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain, and
Wellington Management. Coinbase was previously valued at $1.6 billion back
in August 2017. Link.

\- The SEC brought its first regulatory charges against a cryptocurrency

exchange, EtherDelta, accusing the platform of failing to register with the
SEC and violating securities laws. EtherDelta sold more than 3.6 million
ERC20 tokens over an 18 month period, and was being fined for enabling
trading of tokens that were considered securities without being properly
registered. The action opens up potential lawsuits against decentralized
exchanges, which are not registered with the SEC but allow users to trade
what could be considered security tokens. EtherDelta agreed to pay $388,000
in penalties and fines. Link

\- Bitcoin Cash, which itself was a controversial hard fork from bitcoin

back in 2017, is facing its own contentious hard fork on November 15th.
Back in August Bitcoin ABC, the leading implementation of the Bitcoin Cash
network, announced it would add new features such as smart contract
abilities and scaling improvements to the network. A week after Bitcoin
ABC's proposal, blockchain research firm nChain announced its own
implementation of Bitcoin Cash called Bitcoin SV, which would expand
Bitcoin Cash's block size from its current 32MB to 128MB. Bitcoin SV is the
brain-child of Craig Wright, the controversial figure who has claimed
(without evidence) that he is Satoshi Nakamoto. The two implementations are
incompatible, so the hard fork in November could trigger a hard fork
creating two entirely new separate chains. Bitmain, a major holder of
Bitcoin Cash, is supporting Bitcoin ABC though some of the largest BCH
mining pools appear to be backing BSV. Link

\- A bitcoin millionaire spent $170 million purchasing  67,000 acres of

undeveloped land in Nevada, with the hopes of building the first
blockchain-based community. The community will rely on blockchain for
governance - all decision making power for the project and 90 percent of
any dividends it generates will be held by residents, employees, and future
investors. The structure, called a "distributed collaborative entity" is
supposed to operate on a blockchain where everyone's ownership rights and
voting powers will be recorded in a digital wallet. Construction on the
land won't begin until late 2019. Link

\- Coinbase announced it was adding web browser Brave's Basic Attention

Token (BAT) to its retail trading platform, less than a week after listing
it on Coinbase Pro. The Brave browser blocks broad advertisements and
trackers, but allows advertisers to directly target consumers by paying
them in BAT. BAT can also be used to directly fund content creators via
micropayments. BAT is the second ERC20 token to be listed by Coinbase,
after 0x. Link

\- Israel-based Starkware announced a $30 million Series A round led by

Paradigm, the venture firm founded by Matt Huang (ex-Sequoia) and Fred
Ehrsam (co-founder of Coinbase) The funding will be used to develop
blockchain privacy and scalability solutions. StarkWare describes itself as "providing
cryptographic proofs that are zero-knowledge, succinct, transparent (no
need for a trusted setup), and post-quantum secure." In a zero-knowledge
proof one party can prove to another that they know a specific value
without actually having to do anything more than stating knowledge of the
value. [Link](https://medium.com/@StarkWare/series-a-665d94c855f4)
\- Roughly 30 mobile apps built around kin - the cryptocurrency launched by

mobile messaging app Kik - are expected to launch in the coming weeks. Kik
raised $98 million in one of 2017's biggest ICOs and earlier in the summer
had announced it would support apps built to enable users to use and earn
its Kin token. The apps have various use cases (dating, language learning,
networking, mental health, productivity, and instant messaging) but all
enable users to earn, use and trade the Kin token. Link

\- AT&T and T-Mobile are being sued by victims who were subject to "SIM

swapping" cellphone hacks that led to cryptocurrencies being stolen.
Hackers were able to infiltrate mobile devices to access crypto wallets and
two-factor authentication codes. In one case, an AT&T customer had $621,000
of crypto stolen via a SIM swap attack, despite AT&T assuring the customer
they had increased security on his account following an earlier attempted
hack. Link
