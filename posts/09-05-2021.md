\- Dom Hofmann launched Loot, a new project for game creation using NFTs. People were able to min 8,000 Loot NFTs directly from the contract, only paying gas fees. The NFTs were a unique list of items. No artwork, stats to compare quality, or game rules. The floor for a Loot "bag" shot to thousands of dollars worth of Ethereum in just a few days. People have begun creating their own universes around the list of items. Hofmann released another 1.3 million supply of Loot for free yesterday. Link.
