**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- The number of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain hit highs not seen since Q2 2021 due to the popularity of the Ordinals protocol, which allows NFTs to be stored on the bitcoin network. The launch of Ordinals has led to some of the largest block sizes in the history of Bitcoin and an increase in transaction fees, but has triggered a significant debate within the Bitcoin community on non-financial uses of the network.

\- Kraken has agreed to pay $30 million to settle SEC charges that it offered unregistered securities through its staking-as-a-service platform, ending the program for US customers.

The settlement caused the tokens for decentralized competitors like Lido Finance, Rocket Pool, Persistence, and StaFi to rise on the news.
