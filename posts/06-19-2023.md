\- The SEC said it has not made a decision on whether it will respond to Coinbase’s petition for rulemaking, and would require at least 4 months to decide. Coinbase sued the SEC earlier this year for failing to respond to its rule-making petition. The SEC argued that its recent lawsuit against the exchange for offering unregistered securities was not in retaliation to the lawsuit.

\- Internal SEC documents related to Bill Hinman’s 2018 speech regarding crypto securities law were finally released to the public as part of the SEC’s ongoing lawsuit with Ripple.

Public information shows that Prometheum has hired former SEC and FINRA staff to its team, and that it has plans to launch its own blockchain and token.
