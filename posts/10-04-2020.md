**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- The CFTC filed money-laundering and other civil charges against crypto exchange BitMEX for illegally operating in the US. BitMEX handles more than $1.5 billion of trades each day, making it one of the five biggest exchanges on most days. Prosecutors said BitMEX was used by hackers to launder stolen money, and by people in countries under sanctions like Iran. The US Attorney of New York also filed criminal charges against BitMEX owners for violating the Bank Secrecy Act. Crypto prices fell on the news over uncertainty surrounding the $2 billion in BTC held by the exchange. BitMEX continues to process withdrawals in order to calm investor fees. [Link](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/technology/bitmex-bitcoin-criminal-charges.html).
