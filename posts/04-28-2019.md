#### **THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- The New York attorney general dropped a legal filing alleging Bitfinex, one of the world's largest crypto exchanges, took out $700 million in loans from Tether - a company Bitfinex owns - to cover up $850 million in lost funds. The filing alleges that those funds had gone to a Panamanian payment processor known as Crypto Capital, who said the money had been seized by various government authorities. Its unclear why the capital was sent to Crypto Capital in the first place. The $850 million of 'lost' funds included both customer and corporate dollars.
