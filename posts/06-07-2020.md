**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- Coinbase is reportedly looking to sell blockchain analytics software to the US government, including the DEA and IRS who have expressed interest in using Coinbase Analytics. Public documents show that Coinbase Analytics allows for tracking crypto flows across multiple blockchains, and provides enhanced law enforcement capabilities not found in other tools. The reports come just a year after Coinbase purchased intelligence firm Neutrino. [Link](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/67551/coinbase-irs-dea-analytics-neutrino).  
  
\- Food stamps startup All\_EBT is using the Telos blockchain for a virtual food stamps card. All\_EBT allows EBT recipients to transfer their food stamp benefits to a virtual card, which can be used for online ordering on grocery / food delivery apps like Instacart and DoorDash. 54 million Americans rely on food stamps but the government hasn't prioritized digitizing the program over fears of fraud. Blockchain can mitigate the fraud risks by providing an immutable record of EBT transactions. [Link](https://decrypt.co/31315/facebook-backed-startup-blockchain-digital-food-stamps).   
  
\- Coinbase is slashing rewards for holding USDC on its platform from 1.25% to 0.15%.

\- A new report shows CryptoKitties generated $27 million in revenue in its first year, with $7 million going to the company and $20 million to the breeders on the platform.

\- Bitcoin mining company Bitmain's co-founder and ousted CTO Micree Zhan hired a dozen security guards to take back control of Bitmain's China office. Zhan sent a letter to Bitmain shareholders and employees saying he had taken control, and that employees should return to work. Bitmain is currently pursuing litigation. Bitmain's troubles began in October 2019 when Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu ousted Zhan over difference in opinions over the direction of the business - Zhan wanted to expand Bitmain's offering to AI while Wu wanted to focus on mining. [Link](https://decrypt.co/31192/bitmain-co-founder-storms-china-office-with-a-dozen-security-guards).
