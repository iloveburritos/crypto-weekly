**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), the preferred banking partner for many US start-ups and tech companies, had its operations taken over by the FDIC this week after experiencing a significant bank run. Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, disclosed it had 8% of its reserves at SVB. News of the $3.3 billion exposure sent the price of USDC to below $0.90 as panic selling put pressure on the stablecoin. On Sunday, the Fed announced that SVB deposits would be honored and USDC rebounded to its $1 peg.
