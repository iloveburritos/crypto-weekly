January 3rd was the 17th anniversary of the first ever bitcoin transaction. The technology and ideals behind bitcoin can be traced back to the infamous cypherpunk listserve of the 1990s, whose contributors included crypto pioneers like Hal Finney and Adam Back. In honor of the cypherpunks, we have made an archive of the listserve emails available [here](https://cypherpunk.maaria.com/).
