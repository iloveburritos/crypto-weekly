\- The massive decline in cryptocurrency prices this year has led to many crypto startups closing their doors or laying off staff. Many of the companies are suffering because they kept a portion of their funds in digital assets like bitcoin and ether. When token prices collapsed this year by more than 90 percent in some cases, and the value of bitcoin and ether in their digital wallets thinned out, many developers found they couldn't raise additional funding. Companies who have suffered include ETCDEV, the startup that led development on Ethereum Classic, who announced it was shuttering operations due to a funding crunch. Adult entertainment site SpankChain also faced a cash crunch, which forced it to downsize its team from 12 to 8 people recently.
