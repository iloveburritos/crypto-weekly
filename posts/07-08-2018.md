\- In the first half of the year, more than $760 million in cryptocurrency was stolen from exchanges-- nearly three times more than in all of 2017. There are more than 1,600 crypto coins and tracking them all is increasingly difficult, which gives criminals an opening to cypher coins into anonymous/untraceable wallets.

\- Users spent an all-time high of $2.7 million in ether to send transactions last Monday, leading to higher gas prices on the Ethereum blockchain. Critics say that surging gas prices indicates that Ethereum needs to seriously consider scaling options, such as sharding, in order to decrease congestion and get consumers to continue transacting on the platform.
