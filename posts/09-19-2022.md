**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- The Ethereum Merge took place, bringing the protocol to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Network electricity use by the network fell by 99% with the transition. [Link](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/15/technology/ethereum-merge-crypto.html). [Link](https://decrypt.co/109848/ethereum-energy-carbon-footprint-down-99-percent-merge).  
  
\- The Ethereum Foundation estimates that the Merge will lower global energy consumption by 0.2%, making it one of the single largest decarbonization efforts in history.
