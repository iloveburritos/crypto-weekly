**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- Uniswap, the largest DEX on Ethereum and second largest across all blockchains, is considering using Arbitrum as a second layer scaling solution. Arbitrum uses optimistic rollups and processes transactions on a sidechain that is then settled in batches on the Ethereum mainnet. Arbitrum is launching on Friday and voting for the UNI deployment is taking place through an off-chain snapshot poll where anyone can vote with UNI tokens. Voting is done through signing on MetaMask rather than directly on the blockchain. Uniswap was expected to launch on Optimism, a rival scaling solution, but Optimism delayed its mainnet launch until July. So far, 41 million UNI tokens have voted in favor of the proposal. [Link](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/106277/uniswap-likely-to-expand-to-ethereum-scaling-solution-arbitrum).
