**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 went into effect on Thursday.  
EIP 1559 is an improvement designed to make fees easier to use and to help the network handle demand. It requires a base fee to be burned and then users can also tip miners if they want to encourage their transactions to go through more quickly. Base fees rise when there's higher demand and drops when demand is lower. Over 5,000 ETH has already been burned, representing over 35% of total new coin issuance over the same period. Average fees on Ethereum increased slightly since the upgrade went live, The proposal is intended to make gas fees more predictable; average fees on Ethereum have increased since the upgrade went live. According to Dune Analytics, over 90% of transactions on Ethereum have not leveraged the benefits of EIP 1559 yet. [Dune Analytics](https://dune.xyz/yulesa/EIP-1559-KIP). [Link](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-burns-5000-coins-in-2-days). [Link](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/113756/ethereum-network-burns-12-million-in-eth-in-first-24-hours-since-eip-1559).   
  
\- The proposed infrastructure bill includes legislation to pay for $28 billion of  the increased spending by tightening tax compliance in digital currencies.

A competing proposal has been introduced that would exempt proof-of-work and proof-of-stake systems from new financial reporting requirements. [Link](https://www.coindesk.com/two-senators-propose-exemptions-to-crypto-tax-reporting-required-by-us-infrastructure-bill). [Link](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/crypto-biden-amendment-infrastructure-bill-proof-of-work/).
