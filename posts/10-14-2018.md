\- Microsoft is developing two blockchain products designed to give

consumers greater control of their personal data. The first product is
essentially an 'identity hub' which would store user identity information
and require permission for third parties to access it. The second product
is a wallet-like app that would allow users to manage these permissions,
including the option of revoking access. Link

declines. Link

network, to experiment with publishing stories to the blockchain. Civil is

\- Blockstack, the blockchain startup developing Web 3.0, announced

plans to decentralize its structure. The company wrote in a blog post that

create a non-profit foundation, that will begin contributing to the
ecosystem alongside the existing Blockstack PBC and its venture capital
wing, the Signature Fund. Link

\- Audit giant PWC announced a partnership with decentralized lending

platform Cred to advise on better standards for stablecoin. Cred is working
on its own stablecoin tied to the US dollar. Stablecoins are becoming
increasingly popular, but lack standardization around transparency and
asset reserves. Link

\- Coinbase announced it was shutting down its institutional-investor

focused index fund product. Coinbase Index Fund launched earlier this year
and allowed institutional investors to invest up to $20 million in a
market-weighted index fund with bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum, ethereum
classic, and litecoin. Link

.
\- Tiberius Group announced it was delaying the sale of its

commodity-backed cryptocurrency until December, blaming high fees from
credit-card processors and an inability to process transactions. Roughly
$15 million of orders were not processed, due to 'restrictions' placed on
credit cards. The cryptocurrency is expected to track a basket of
commodities including copper, aluminum, nickel, cobalt, tin, gold and
platinum. Link

.
\- Binance announced it would donate all listing fees to its charity,

the Blockchain Charity Foundation, a not-for-profit organization dedicated
to advancing blockchain-enabled philanthropy. The cryptocurrency exchange
often receives fees from companies who want to get their coins listed on
the exchange. The announcement was likely a response to accusations that
Binance had charged as much as $2.6 million for projects to get listed.
