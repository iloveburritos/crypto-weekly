**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

**[Maaria & Dave Note] This week included a myriad of regulatory and legislative events that will influence the future of crypto in the United States. Given the breadth of the events, crypto weekly has a different format than usual.**  
  
*TL;DR: The SEC brought charges against two of the largest crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase, for violating securities laws and operating as unregistered exchanges by selling tokens such as Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), Sandbox (SAND), Axie Infinity (AXIE). The SEC has yet to bring lawsuits against the protocols themselves.   
  
In addition to securities violations, the SEC also brought fraud charges against Binance and its CEO CZ, alleging misappropriation of customer funds as well as non-compliance with banking rules. Most notably, the lawsuit against Coinbase does not include allegations of fraud and does not name Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong personally.   
  
For those interested in crypto policy and legislation in the United States, tomorrow will be a big day to watch. The 'Hinman docs', internal emails from the SEC staff discussing crypto policy, will finally be made public. The SEC will respond to an order on Coinbase's petition for regulatory clarity. The SEC will also make its case on its motion to temporarily freeze Binance US assets.*  
  
  
  
**BINANCE LAWSUIT**

\- A US judge ordered the SEC to clarify its position on Coinbase’s petition from July 2022 asking the Commission to clarify its regulations around digital assets.
