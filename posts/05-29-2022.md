**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- The Beacon Chain, the proof-of-stake Ethereum chain running in parallel to the current proof-of-work chain, experienced a 7-block reorganization event on Wednesday. The term reorg refers to block confirmations diverging, often resulting in a forked network. In this case it appears the reorg was due to certain upgrades not being fully rolled out to the entire network. Ethereum fell this week as investors speculated that the Beacon Chain reorg would likely delay the merge of Beacon Chain with Ethereum mainnet, which is currently expected to occur in August. A post-mortem with more details is expected soon. [Link](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-beacon-chain-experiences-7-block-reorg-what-s-going-on). [Link](https://decrypt.co/101495/ethereum-liquidations-top-157m-merge-upgrade-test-hits-snag).
