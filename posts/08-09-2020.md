**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

BTC trading has been climbing since early July and nearly doubled in the last month; current BTC trading volume is more than double that seen at the height of the 2017 bull run. Though it's uncertain what caused the sharp sell-off, some speculate it was triggered by a wave of automated liquidations. [Link](https://decrypt.co/37440/bitcoin-touches-12k-before-suffering-massive-rejection).
