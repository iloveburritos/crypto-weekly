**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- Iran became the first country in the world to officially declare bitcoin as an international medium of exchange. Iranian miners can now sell their cryptocurrency to the Central Bank of Iran.

\- President Trump's campaign website was briefly hacked on Tuesday. The hackers claimed to have information discrediting Trump and provided two Monero addresses.
