#### **THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- Basis, the startup that raised $133 million from top tier VCs to launch a stablecoin, announced it was shutting down and returning capital to investors. The company cited the regulatory environment as a key reason for the decision. Basis believed its token would be considered a security and subsequently subject to transfer restrictions and ownership limitation to accredited investors. Basis investors include Bain Capital Ventures, GV, Lightspeed, Andreessen Horowitz, DCG and others.

\- The US CFTC is looking for public feedback on ethereum, ranging from its technology to how it is used. The "Request for Input" (RFI) lists 25 different questions about ether and the network, and covers topics such as ethereum's upcoming move to proof-of-stake, scalability issues, governance, cybersecurity, and custody. Respondents have 60 days to submit answers, which will then be used to inform the agency's oversight of the ethereum market. While officials representing the US SEC have previously suggested that ether is not a security, the CFTC has not yet taken an official position on the cryptocurrency. [Link](https://www.coindesk.com/the-cftc-is-trying-to-learn-more-about-ethereum).   


\- Coinbase's Chief Product Officer, Jeremy Henrickson, has left the company. Henrickson started with Coinbase in July 2016 and served as VP of Product and Engineering before becoming CPO in 2017.

\- US-based crypto exchange Kraken is offering a very small, select number of clients the opportunity to purchase Kraken shares at a $4 billion valuation. Kraken is profitable and has significant cash on hand, but is opportunistically raising cash to align interests with its top clients and build a war chest for acquisitions in the bear market. The opportunity is not available to the general public or external investors. [Link](https://www.coindesk.com/kraken-is-seeking-war-chest-investment-at-a-4-billion-valuation).
