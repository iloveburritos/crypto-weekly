**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- Bitcoin jumped to a two-week high above $40,000 as crypto traders grew more confident that the market had stabilized. BTC had dipped briefly after the US Labor Dept reported unexpectedly strong jobs growth, but rallied soon after along with the broader market.

\- Metaverse-related tokens like Axie Infinity (AXS), Sandbox (SAND), and Decentraland (GALA) fell as much as 12% in 24 hours as Meta, formerly known as Facebook, reported a $10 billion loss on its AR/VR division in its earnings report.

\- Wormhole, a cross-chain bridging protocol created by Certus one, lost 120,000 ETH ($325 million) in an exploit this week, crypto's fourth-largest and DeFi's largest heist of all time.

This depleted the reserves of staked ETH that supported the bridged Ethereum on Solana. Soon after the attack, Jump Capital (which had acquired Certus One last August) announced it had replaced the 120k ETH That was stolen and brought reserves back to 1:1 ratio. [Link](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/02/03/jump-trading-backstops-wormholes-320m-exploit-loss-sources/).
