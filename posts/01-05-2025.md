*Crypto weekly is authored by [maaria](https://x.com/maariabajwa) and [david blumenfeld](https://x.com/serdave_eth)*


January 3rd was the 16th anniversary of the first ever bitcoin transaction. The technology and ideals behind bitcoin and modern day cryptocurrency can be traced back to the infamous cypherpunk listserve in the 1990s, whose contributors included crypto pioneers like Hal Finney and Adam Back. In honor of this cypherpunk community, we have made an archive of the listserve emails available **[here](https://archives.maaria.com/)**.
