**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- PayPal and Venmo are planning to allow their combined 325 million users to buy and sell crypto directly from the platforms. It is unclear which or how many cryptocurrencies would be available. The service could be expected in the next three months. [Link](https://www.coindesk.com/paypal-venmo-to-roll-out-crypto-buying-and-selling).   
  
\- Users transacted more than $180 billion in bitcoin in Q2 2020, an average of almost $2 billion per day. Users transacted $178 billion in Q1 2020 so spending was relatively flat. [Link](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/70403/more-than-180-billion-in-bitcoin-was-transacted-on-chain-during-2020s-q2).   
  
\- USD Coin (USDC), a stablecoin projected founded by Coinbase and Circle, just broke $1 billion market cap for the first time since it launched in October 2018. It is now the second-largest USD-backed stablecoin after Tether (USDT), and is currently the 18th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. [Link](https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-and-circle-backed-stablecoin-usd-coin-breaks-1b-market-cap).   
  
\- Telegram will pay an $18.5 million fine to the SEC over its failed TON offering. It will also repay investors $1.19 billion, roughly 70% of their initial investment.

\- A Fifth Circuit panel of judges ruled that BTC transaction data is not protected by the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. The ruling occurred in connection with a case in which someone used cryptocurrency to pay for access to illicit child pornography websites. The FBI subpoenaed Coinbase to track payments to the websites. The court's decision means that in criminal proceedings Bitcoin account balances are treated like bank records. [Link](https://dailyhodl.com/2020/07/04/bitcoin-btc-transaction-records-not-protected-by-fourth-amendment-us-court-rules/).

The company uses a technique called multi-party computation (MPC), which involves several parties each with different strings of numbers that interact using a protocol instead of single private key. The process creates a public key to receive funds, and a distributed and separate way to sign transactions in order to send funds. [Link](https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-ventures-joins-23m-funding-round-for-crypto-custody-firm-curv).
