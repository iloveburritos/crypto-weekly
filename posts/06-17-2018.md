**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**
\- This week the SEC said that Ether is not a security, but that tokens built off of the Ethereum blockchain could still be considered securities. The key for the SEC is whether the token in question is being used simply for the exchange of a good or service through a distributed ledger platform, or whether the value of the cryptocurrency is dependent on the actions of a third party for it to rise in value. Even in cases where the token is a security today, the SEC gave indications that if the token is successful in building a decentralized network it would cease to regulate the token as a security.

\- Nvidia continues its expansion in blockchain and is now working with a startup called Ubex to develop a smart online marketing platform that uses blockchain and AI. Ubex is using neural networks to more efficiently present advertisements on websites and believes it can collect datasets faster by using blockchain to underpin the service. The data is stored in a distributed ledger system and will allow them to attract thousands of sources of information that can enrich the AI’s database.

\- Y-Combinator backed Quantstamp is being accused of misleading investors and undermining the value of its token. The company recently raised $65 million in its token offering. According to the company’s published materials, customers are meant to trade and make payments in the Quantstamp token. However, the startup also accepts payment in Ethereum and USD which token purchasers argue the company did not make clear and ultimately undermines the value of the token. Community members also raised concerns last week over the company’s use of open-source technology in the 489 smart contract audits it claims to have completed to date.

\- Walmart files a patent that would let users prepay a capped amount of cryptocurrency to cover the expected electricity demands for specific devices. Since the transactions would occur on a public ledger, energy providers would be able to accurately allocate the required electricity to the household. Overall, the system would be much more transparent and could ultimately lead to a balancing of supply/demand and energy savings.

\- New startup Elph wants to be the “Netscape for crypto” by making it easier for users to find and use blockchain-based apps. The platform aims for simplicity, users simply sign up with an email and password, and Elph then handles account management across apps based on the unique ID that it assigns them. The platform allows users to easily see how their crypto portfolios are performing, buy/sell CryptoKitties, or to find/use other decentralized apps.

\- Hackers pushed malicious, downloadable images to a Docker Hub registry. The images contained programs that had been designed to mine the cryptocurrency Monero. The images had been downloaded 5 million times before the breach had been discovered and the hackers were able to mine $90,000 of Monero, which is a small but significant amount for this type of hack.

\- The Bank for International Settlements released a 24-page article saying that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies suffer from a range of shortcoming that would prevent them from ever fulfilling the lofty expectations that have prompted an explosion of interest in the asset class. The group cited instability, electricity consumption, and rampant fraud and manipulation possible because of decentralization as the primary reasons cryptocurrencies would ultimately not break through.
