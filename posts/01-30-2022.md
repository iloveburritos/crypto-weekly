**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- Meta (fka Facebook) is winding down its never-launched stablecoin project, Diem (fka Libra) and selling the assets to Silvergate Capital for $200 million. [Link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-cryptocurrency-venture-to-wind-down-sell-assets-11643248799).   
  
\- YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said the company was exploring helping its content creators capitalize on NFTs. [Link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-25/youtube-will-explore-nft-features-for-video-creators-ceo-says).   
  
\- The team behind Etherscan released a beta of Blockscan Chat, a messaging platform for users to message each other wallet-to-wallet. The service isn't decentralized though, and messages will run through Etherscan's servers. [Link](https://decrypt.co/91226/etherscan-creators-launch-ethereum-instant-messenger-blockscan-chat).   
  
\- Leaked screenshots show OpenSea supporting Solana NFTs and the popular Solana wallet, Phantom. [Link](https://decrypt.co/91220/opensea-solana-nfts-phantom-wallet-leaked-images).   
  
\- A new Chainalysis report shows that $8.6 billion worth of crypto was laundered in 2021, a 30% increase over 2020 but still less than 2019's $10.9 billion. Money laundering accounted for just 0.05% of all crypto transaction volume in 2021. And by comparison there are estimates that between $800 billion and $2 trillion of fiat currency is laundered each year. [Link](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-preview-cryptocurrency-money-laundering/).   
  
\- JPMorgan Chase closed Uniswap founder's bank accounts without notice. The move comes a few months after the SEC reportedly started investigating Uniswap Labs, the main developer behind Uniswap. [Link](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/131314/jpmorgan-chase-closes-uniswap-founders-bank-accounts).   
  
\- 0xSifu, a co-founder and CFO of Avalanche-based fork of OlympusDAO called Wonderland, was outed as the co-founder of the notorious Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX, which has been labeled as a ponzi scheme by officials. The community voted to remove Sifu as the protocol's treasury manager and is now voting on whether to wind down Wonderland. [Link](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/27/how-did-a-former-quadriga-exec-end-up-running-a-defi-protocol-wonderland-founder-explains/). [Link](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/132340/wonderland-votes-out-quadrigacx-co-founder-sifu-and-is-considering-shutting-down). [Link](https://decrypt.co/91354/cfo-defi-project-wonderland-ousted-co-founder-quadrigacx-report).

\- Popular algorithmic stablecoins including Terra's $UST and Abracadabra's $MIM risked depegging from their dollar pegs, as users fled Frog Nation projects. Frog Nation is a series of DeFi protocols founded by Daniele Sestagalli and includes Wonderland, Abracadabra, and Popsicle Finance. Confidence in Daniele fell after it was revealed he knew Wonderland's treasury manager 0xSifu had been been involved in past frauds. Users pulled over $2 billion of liquidity from the MIM-3CRV pool on Curve, leading to a severe pool imbalance that was 95% $MIM and 5% 3CRV and an almost 2% decoupling from the dollar. This in turn effected Terra's UST stablecoin which is often used as collateral for leveraged $MIM yield farming. [Link](https://thedefiant.io/frog-nation-cfo-scandal/).

\- Paradigm is working on a new NFT pricing mechanism called CRISP (Constant Rate Issuance Sales Protocol) which aims to sell NFTs at a targeted rate over time.
