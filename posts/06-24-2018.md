**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**
\- Creditors of the defunct bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox received a massive victory this week when the Mt. Gox trustee announced that a civil rehabilitation process would commence and those seeking to recoup funds from the exchange could see their money sometime in the next year. Mt. Gox was once the world’s largest exchange by trade volume before it dramatically collapsed in 2014, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. The document mentions that creditors seeking to regain their lost funds in bitcoin may receive pro rata distributions at more than $440 per bitcoin, the value of bitcoin at the time of the bankruptcy proceedings.

\- Walmart has been awarded a patent for a system that would store medical records on a blockchain from a wearable device. The system would allow medical professionals to retrieve medical data from a patient that is unable to communicate — the patient’s medical records would theoretically be stored on a blockchain, accessible by a device worn by the patient that first responders could access with an RFID scanner.

\- StreetCred raises $1 million from Bowery Capital and Notation Capital to build a marketplace where users are rewarded for collecting location data on local businesses. Founder/CEO Randy Meech has been working in mapping for years, previously serving as the CTO at MapQuest and then CEO at Mapzen, an open-source mapping subsidiary of Samsung, which was shut down earlier this year. StreetCred is collecting data on the blockchain which means the data is decentralized and essentially cannot be shut down. [Link](https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/20/streetcred/).

\- Coinbase has been the subject of many concerns recently, with the US SEC and California Department of Business Oversight reportedly receiving 134 pages of complaints from Coinbase users about their issues with the platform. The documents were obtained by Mashable following a 5-month FOIA process. Users complained about issues around accessing their funds or being locked out of their accounts. Coinbase’s user growth seems to be outpacing its resources — in October 2017 the company had 11.7 million users, up 148 percent from 4.7 million users the year before.

\- Quebec’s public power utility submits plan to parcel out 500 megawatts worth of power to crypto miners.
