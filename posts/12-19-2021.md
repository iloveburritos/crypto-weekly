**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- The US Senate heard testimony this week on stablecoins. There was discussion over a proposal from the President's Working Group which advocated for Congress to limit stablecoin issuance to insured depository institutions (essentially banks). Republicans want a more open system for issuing stablecoins which would allow for groups like Circle to issue USDC despite not having a banking license. Overall it appears that stablecoin legislation is top of mind for Congress, especially since the Financial Stability Oversight Council is aiming to get emergency authority over stablecoins if Congress doesn't provide guidance soon.
