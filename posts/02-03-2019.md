#### **THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- Bitcoin is officially in the longest stretch of declining prices in its 10-year history. Bitcoin achieved an all-time high of $19.764 on Dec 17, 2017 and is on day 411 of its longest bear market. The currency has lost more than 84 percent of value from its all-time high. Previously, the longest bear market was from 2013 - 2015 when Bitcoin saw its price fall 86 percent. The most severe bear market was 163 days long in 2011 -- the currency saw its price fall more than 93 percent during that time.

\- Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange based on trading volume, has added support for purchasing crypto with Visa and Mastercard.

\- Fidelity announced that its crypto trading and custody platform, called Fidelity Digital Asset Services, was in its 'final testing' phase.

\- A new report from Chainalysis indicates that two groups are responsible for approximately $1 billion in crypto hacks, a sum that accounts for the majority of the money lost in such scams. Chainalysis spent three months tracking the funds stolen in known hacks and believes that majority of the hacks come from two groups, which it labeled alpha and beta. The report claims Alpha is a "giant, tightly controlled organization at least partly driven by non monetary goals". Beta, the second group, is smaller and less organized, and is a "heavily sanctioned organization absolutely focused on the money". Stolen funds were transferred an averaged of 5,000 times before they were converted into cash.

\- Crypto custody startup Casa launched a browser extension for its lightning network-enabled bitcoin node. Users will be able to interact with their Casa Nodes - hardware devices that connect to and help validate the bitcoin blockchain - directly on any crypto website with lightning network functionality. Lightning is a layer-two payments protocol run on top of the bitcoin network to facilitate faster and larger transactions.

\- Messaging app company Kik is planning to fight a likely SEC enforcement action over its 2017 ICO where it raised almost $100 million for its Kin token.

\- Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX owes its customers $190 million in both crypto and fiat and cannot access most of the funds.

The exchange's crypto holdings total $147 million including $92 million of Bitcoin, $46 million of ether, and $6.5 million of Litecoin. The company has since filed for creditor protection.
