**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- Mila Kunis is releasing an animated show called Stoner Cats through a series of NFTs. The project is the first of its kind to use NFTs as a new content production model. The NFTs are expected to be released in mid July. [Link](https://cointelegraph.com/news/calling-the-crypto-space-a-very-masculine-area-mila-kunis-launches-nft-project). [Author note: I'm personally involved in this project - read my tweets about it [here](https://twitter.com/maariabajwa/status/1406034506109259778)].   
  
\- DeFi project Iron Finance witnessed a bank run on its partially collateralized stablecoin $IRON, which caused the price of the project's token TITAN to drop almost 100%. The IRON stablecoin was intended to be pegged to $1, with the TITAN token used as collateral. This design was supposed to allow the stablecoin to absorb market volatility caused by shifts in supply and demand. However, a few large whales began to liquidate tehir position early last week which caused a negative feedback loop and a fall in the price. This led to a run on the bank and a collapse in the project's token price from a peak of $60 to $0. Investors like Mark Cuban called for stablecoin regulations after the events. [Link](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/iron-finance-details-defi-bank-052135662.html). [Link](https://micky.com.au/mark-cuban-loses-money-on-a-defi-project-calls-for-more-stablecoin-regulation/).
