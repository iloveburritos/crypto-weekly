**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- Grayscale Investments, a leading crypto asset management firm, raised over $700 million on Jan 15 from institutional investors, its largest single asset raise day ever. In Q4 2020 the company brought in $3.3 billion across a range of products. [Link](https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2021/01/grayscale-700-million-24-hours).   
  
\- A bipartisan group of House legislators reintroduced the Financial Tech Protection Act, which seeks to establish a task force to fight crypto-financed criminal activity. The bill has passed the House twice, but failed to pass the Senate both times. [Link](https://decrypt.co/54340/crypto-crime-bill-financial-technology-protection-act). Though illicit transactions make up only 1% of all crypto activity, crypto-financed crimes remain an issue. The most recent example came during the January 6 riot at the Capitol. According to Chainalysis an anonymous French donor sent over $500,000 in BTC to 22 far-right activists and internet personalities who were present at the Capitol. [Link](https://decrypt.co/54187/bitcoin-was-used-to-finance-pro-trump-capitol-riot-reports).
