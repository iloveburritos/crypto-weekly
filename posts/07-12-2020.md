**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- A viral TikTok video caused the price of Dogecoin (DOGE) to surge 43%, driving the token's price to its highest value since 2018, $0.0045. The video creators asked TikTok users to invest $25 into the currency to drive the price to $1. In response crypto exchanges Binance, Okex, and Bitfinex all expanded their support for Dogecoin making various derivatives and swaps available for traders. [Link](https://decrypt.co/35081/three-crypto-exchanges-boost-support-for-trading-dogecoin). [TikTok video](https://vm.tiktok.com/JLmbAcA/).   
  
\- Crypto exchange Coinbase is reportedly preparing for a US stock market listing that could come this year.

Coinbase was last valued at $8 billion in 2018. [Link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-coinbase-ipo-exclusive/exclusive-cryptocurrency-exchange-coinbase-readies-stock-market-listing-sources-idUSKBN24A21W).

\- Chainalysis data shows that only 19% of Bitcoin's circulating supply is being traded at any given time. Roughly 20% has likely been lost to dead-end addresses or forgotten wallets. The remaining 60% has been untouched for years, likely held by long-term "hodlers". These entities have never sold more than 25% of the bitcoin they've ever received. [Link](https://decrypt.co/32806/only-19-percent-bitcoin-being-traded-report).   
  
\- DeFi protocols like Compound and Balancer are now handing out $25 million a month to users. The platforms have launched an incentivization technique called "Liquidity Mining" which rewards "yield farmers" for using the protocol and providing liquidity. The rewards often come in the form of the protocol's native token and in the case of Compound, in the form of their governance token COMP. "Yield Farming" is where traders move their assets to the DeFi pools offering the best APY from week to week. With Liquidity mining, a yield farmer gets a new token, as well as the usual APY return, in exchange for providing liquidity on the protocol. The idea for the protocol's is that as network usage increases, token value increases, thereby driving usage and continuing the cycle; they offer these extra incentives to get people using the platform. [Link](https://decrypt.co/34831/defi-platforms-are-handing-out-25-million-a-month). [Overview of Liquidity Mining](https://www.coindesk.com/defi-yield-farming-comp-token-explained).
