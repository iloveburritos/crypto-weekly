**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- Yuga Labs, the company behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection, raised $450 million at a $4 billion valuation for its seed funding round led by a16z. The company also announced its gaming and metaverse project, Otherside, which it descried as an MMORPG meant to connect the broader NFT universe. [Link](https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/22/22991272/yuga-labs-seed-funding-a16z-bored-ape-yacht-club-bayc-metaverse-other-side).   
  
\- A recent Goldman Sachs survey of 172 clients showed that 60% expect to increase their digital asset holdings in the next 1-2 years with 32% responding they expected to "significantly increase" their crypto holdings. 51% reported already having exposure to crypto, compared to 40% from the previous year. 14% expressed interest in DeFi tokens and 9% were interested in NFTs. [Link](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/139124/goldman-sachs-crypto-survey-march).   
  
\- Total value locked (TVL), the sum of all staked crypto assets that are earning rewards and interest across all DeFi protocols, has fallen 16% from its peak in December 2021, but is still up 3x from a year ago. [Link](https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/23/despite-declines-the-value-of-crypto-assets-in-defi-protocols-is-up-3x-from-a-year-ago/).   
  
\- Bitcoin's correlation with the S&P 500 is at its highest since October 2020, which is approximately when Bitcoin began its ascent from the crypto winter to back above $20k. 90 day correlation is around 0.49. [Link](https://decrypt.co/95820/bitcoins-correlation-with-sp-500-reaches-17-month-high).   
  
\- Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen cautiously acknowledged the benefits of crypto and blockchain tech, saying that "innovation in the payment system can be a healthy thing". She also suggested that Bitcoin and digital assets are not a fad, and that "crypto has obviously grown by leaps and bounds". Yellen has long been a crypto skeptic. [CNBC Interview](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/03/25/treasury-secretary-janet-yellen-on-crypto-i-have-some-skepticism-but-there-are-benefits.html).  
  
\- DeFi's Anchor Protocol is offering 20% interest on UST stablecoin deposits. Anchor and UST are both powered by the Terra blockchain. The yield is the largest in the ecosystem by far, and has caused a rise in demand for UST-- the largest algorithmic stablecoin with a market cap of $15 billion-- which could test the stablecoin's ability to stay pegged to the US dollar. UST isn't backed by fiat currency like USDC and instead it maintains its peg to the dollar by burning LUNA, the native token of Terra blockchain. [Link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-23/terra-s-promise-of-20-defi-return-raises-sustainability-concern). A community vote on Thursday will now dynamically adjust interest rates each month -- payout rates will increase by 1.5% if yield reserves increase and drop by 1.5% if yield reserves fall by 5%. The move is aimed at making Anchor more sustainable in the longer term. [Link](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/25/anchor-protocol-will-readjust-interest-rates-each-month-anc-falls-by-5/).   
  
\- India is considering a tax law that would tax crypto income at 30%, and would limit the ability to offset losses from one asset against the profits of another. [Link](https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/21/india-crypto-tax/).   
  
\- Ethereum continues outperforming bitcoin, driven largely by the network moving closer to the Merge upgrade scheduled for later this year, which will move the blockchain to a proof of stake consensus system. [Link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-25/ether-outshines-bitcoin-for-second-week-as-update-optimism-grows).

\- The US Department of Justice brought fraud charges against the duo behind Frosties, an NFT project alleged to be a 'rug pull'.

\- Katie Haun, a former GP of a16z crypto, raised $1.5 billion for her new solo project, Haun Ventures. $500 million is earmarked for early stage venture investments, with $1 billion being set aside for companies looking for growth stage capital. [Link](https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/22/following-a16z-departure-katie-haun-debuts-haun-ventures-with-1-5b-in-capital-to-back-crypto-startups/).   
  
\- A Twitter phishing scam defrauded crypto users of more than $1 million through a phony ApeCoin airdrop, where users were promised ApeCoin for 0.33 ETH even if they didn't hold Bored Ape NFTs.
