TOP 5 DAPPS BY DAILY ACTIVE USERS
\- Dapps (decentralized applications) are still relatively new, but they continue to be built on promises of no downtime, censorship, or third-party interference – an alternative to centralized and censorable applications available today. Coindesk recently analyzed the top 5 dApps by daily active users. These dApps are built on Ethereum, and while they all have their own native tokens, the native tokens are not required to use the platforms. With the exception of CryptoKitties, the most used dApps are used for trading Ethereum and ethereum-based tokens. See summary of list below.
1. Idex: decentralized exchange offering trading in ether and ERC20 tokens. 6,479 DAUs.
2. ForkDelta: decentralized exchange offering trading in ether and ERC20 tokens. 2,221 DAUs.
3. Bancor: market maker that allows users to exchange ether and ERC20 tokens (unlike Idea and ForkDelta which are exchanges, Bancor uses smart contracts to enable trades). 560 DAUs.
4. CryptoKitties: platform for users to collect, trade and breed unique, non-replicable cats. Ultimately the protocol could be used to tokenize real-world assets such as art and real estate. 408 DAUs.
5. LocalEthereum: facilitates trades of ether between individuals using an escrow smart contract. 236 DAUs.

**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**
\- Bitcoin tumbled 12 percent Sunday as South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Coinrail said there was a ‘cyber intrusion’ in its system, and that it had lost more than $40 million in altcoins.

\- Crypto markets fell on Sunday as the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission demanded extensive trading data from several cryptocurrency exchanges. Regulators requested data in order to investigate whether manipulation might be compromising prices in digital currencies market. The probe followed the launch of BTC futures by CME Group in December, which formed its BTC futures prices based on data from four exchanges: BitStamp, Coinbase, itBit, and Kraken, where manipulative trading could have distorted value of BTC futures.

\- MasterCard furthers its arsenal of blockchain-related patents with a new patent application to essentially put credit cards on a public blockchain. The patent application would integrate with point-of-sale devices. In addition, MasterCard also revealed a patent application to build a blockchain to allow consumers to broadcast their travel itineraries and reservation requests to merchants – because the broadcasted information will be visible to the public, merchants have the chance to bid for potential customers over the blockchain, potentially changing the existing model of hotel and air ticket aggregators.

\- The SEC appoints a new designated crypto advisor to spearhead the application of securities laws across cryptocurrencies and ICOs.
