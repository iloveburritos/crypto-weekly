**SAM BANKMAN-FRIED TRIAL COVERAGE**

Trial transcripts have not been released, so trial highlights cited below are based off second-hand recaps from journalists and others reporting on the case. 

**TUESDAY**  
\- The government confirmed it had never offered Sam Bankman-Fried a plea deal  
  
**WEDNESDAY**  
\- In opening statements, prosecutors argued SBF deliberately lied and knowingly allowed his hedge fund Alameda Research to illegally borrow FTX customer deposits   
\- Defense lawyers argued the loans FTX made to Alameda were legal, and the exchange’s insolvency was the result of mismanagement, not criminal intent.   
\- Adam Yedidia, a college friend of SBF’s who eventually joined FTX as a software engineer, testified that FTX did not have its own bank account until 2022, and had used an Alameda-controlled account at Silvergate Bank to accept customer deposits.   
  
**THURSDAY**  
\- Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang said the firm had marked its $278 million investment in FTX to $0.   
\- FTX CTO Gary Wang, who has pled guilty to charges and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, testified that Alameda had been allowed to have a negative balance at FTX as early as July 2019. This allowed the hedge fund to bypass automated procedures at the exchange and withdraw more than it had deposited.  
\- Wang testified Alameda had a negative balance of $200 million in early 2020, which was higher than FTX’s revenues from trading fees at the time. The difference was made up with a ‘line of credit’ funded by customer deposits.   
\- SBF eventually authorized a $65 billion line of credit to Alameda, giving it virtually unlimited access to FTX customer deposits.   
  
**FRIDAY**  
\- Wang testified that SBF contemplated shutting Alameda down in September 2022, but had no way of covering the $14 billion the hedge fund had borrowed.    
\- Wang said the exchange was short $8 billion of customer deposits in November 2022  
\- A few days after FTX declared bankruptcy SBF ordered Wang to transfer FTX’s money to Bahamian securities officials, because they “seemed friendly” and would allow SBF to preserve some stake in the business.   
  
**NEXT WEEK**  
\- The defense will resume cross-examination of Wang on Tuesday.   
\- Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison is expected to testify next. Like Wang, she has pled guilty to charges and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.
