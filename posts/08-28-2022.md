**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- Crypto markets whipsawed following Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell’s warning that high borrowing rates were not going away soon, and that there is more economic pain on the horizon. BTC and ETH fell nearly 10% on the news. [Link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-26/cryptocurrencies-drift-lower-as-bitcoin-settles-in-narrow-range). [Link](https://www.theblock.co/post/165927/markets-whipsaw-following-jerome-powells-hawkish-speech-at-jackson-hole).  
  
\- SEC chair Gary Gensler wrote an op-ed in the WSJ discussing the SEC’s role in enforcing securities laws, and said the agency would not treat the crypto markets any differently. [Link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-sec-treats-crypto-like-the-rest-of-the-capital-markets-disclosure-compliance-security-investment-mutual-fund-protections-blockfi-bankruptcy-bitcoin-11660937246).   
  
\- The Merge, Ethereum’s move to proof of stake from its current proof of work model, will kick off with the Bellatrix update on September 6. This will begin a 14-day period to the mainnet Merge, which is expected to occur on September 20. [Link](https://www.theblock.co/post/165477/ethereum-foundation-confirms-september-dates-for-the-merge). [EF Blog Post](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/08/24/mainnet-merge-announcement).

\- DeFi lending platform Compound launched Compound III, a new version of the protocol that shifts away from the pooled-risk approach where users can borrow any asset. Instead, each instance of Compound III will feature a single borrowable asset and will limit the tokens that can be deposited as collateral. This new approach should eliminate the risk of a single bad asset draining all assets from the protocol. Initially, Compound III will allow users to borrow USDC using ETH, wBTC, LINK, UNI and COMP as collateral. Though users won’t earn interest on collateral anymore, they will be able to borrow more and have less risk of liquidation and lower liquidation penalties.

\- OpenSea’s former Head of Product, Nathaniel Chastain, filed a motion to dismiss wire fraud charges on the basis that NFTs are neither commodities nor securities and hence can not be used as evidence of wire fraud.

\- DeFi protocol Synthetix is considering moving away from its current inflationary token model and capping the supply of its tokens at 300M. Founder Kain Warwick says the inflationary model worked for bootstrapping the network, but is no longer needed because the protocol is generating revenue from its atomic swap and perpetual products. [Link](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/26/defi-platform-synthetixs-founder-proposes-capping-token-supply-at-300m-heres-why/).

\- Lending rates have increased between 0.5% and 2% over the past month across most major lending platforms due to less liquidity caused by the collapse of major lending platforms like Celsius and Voyager.

\- Coinbase unveiled cbETH, a liquid staking token that will compete with Lido’s stETH token. Both cbETH and stETH are liquid staking tokens given to users in exchange for depositing their ETH in staking pools to earn mining rewards in Ethereum’s new proof of stake model. cbETH and stETH can eventually be redeemed for ETH 1:1, but in the meantime these tokens provide a proxy for users to continue using ETH.
