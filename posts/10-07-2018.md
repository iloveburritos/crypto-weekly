\- Despite declining crypto prices, institutional investors are buying

crypto assets, just not on exchanges. The over-the-counter market
facilitated anywhere from $250 million to $30 billion in trades per day in

volatility in crypto pricing has declined. While volume on exchanges is
down 80 percent since its peak, reports indicate that the over-the-counter
market is growing. Link

in the world is counterfeit. Overstock's investment arm, Medici Ventures,
is reportedly making "a seven-figure investment" into the company. Link

\- A luxury Manhattan condo development appraised at $30 million is being

tokenized on the ethereum blockchain. The developer is turning to
tokenization instead of traditional financing in order to bring

companies that offer compliant products and services  for the creation and
distribution of digital securities. Link

recently launched $300 million crypto fund. Yale is one of the few large
