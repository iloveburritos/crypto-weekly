**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- Bitcoin experienced it's third-ever block reward halving, dropping the per-block subsidy from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC. The halving takes place roughly ever four years, and is a key part of bitcoin's digital scarcity model where only 21 million BTC will ever be produced. The halvening could wipe out smaller mining operations that won't be able to survive the 50% reduction in revenue and hstorically it has also been followed by significant increases in BTC prices. [Link]().   
  
\- Telegram is no longer pursuing a crypto strategy after running into regulatory hurdles from the SEC. Telegram had raised $1.8B ICO in 2018 to create the Telegram Open Network (TON) backed by its cryptocurrency GRAMs, and late last year the SEC filed a lawsuit alleging the ICO was an illegal sale of unregistered securities. Since then the US courts blocked Telegram from issuing GRAM tokens to any US investors, and just last week a judge ruled that US citizens might find some way of accessing the TON platform after it launched, so the platform couldn't be allowed either. TON Labs, a startup running a test network, launched its own version of the network last week, but Telegram itself is not involved. [Link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2020/05/12/telegram-gives-up-on-its-blockchain-crypto-project/).
  
\- Redditors will now earn rewards in the form of ERC-20 tokens for creating engaging content on two subreddits: r/Cryptocurrency and r/FortniteBR. Reddit community members can use tokens to vote, tip content creators, and transfer funds. Users can access their tokens through Vault, a wallet that shows their community points and allows them to buy premium community features such as badges, custom emojis, and GIFs. Reddit's reward system is currently being beta tested and is expected to move to the Ethereum mainnet in summer 2020. [Link](https://www.theblock.co/linked/65178/reddit-launches-ethereum-based-tokens-for-cryptocurrency-and-fortnite-subreddits).

\- Ripple is hiring a "Director of Product Management, Loans" indicating the startup behind the XRP cryptocurrency may be moving into the lending space.

\- Total AUM of crypto hedge funds doubled to over $2 billion in 2019. Quant funds make up over half of the crypto hedge funds in the market, but long-only strategies had the best performance. The median long-only fund was +40% in 2019, compared to quant strategies which were up +30%. It is mostly family offices and HNW individuals who invested in crypto hedge funds; only a handful of funds had foundations, endowments, and VC funds as investors. No pension funds were cited as investors. [Link](https://www.theblock.co/post/64671/crypto-hedge-funds-assets-under-management-doubled-in-2019-to-over-2-billion-new-report-indicates).   
  
\- A special collection of CryptoKitties debuted on Nifty Gateway, a fine-art marketplace backed by the Winklevoss twins. Chinese artist Momo Wang created a Crypto Kitty called "Catterina" and is selling 100 images on Nifty Gateway, at $100 a piece. Nifty Gateway is a marketplace for digital artists to sell limited editions of their artwork; because transactions are logged on the blockchain artists can also take a cut of sales from the secondary market. [Link](https://decrypt.co/28892/crypto-kitties-winklevoss-nifty-gateway).
