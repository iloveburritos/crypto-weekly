**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- DeFi startup Fairmint is launching a Continuous Securities Offering (CSO) platform, a new financing model that lets users invest in startups based on their revenue performance. Companies raising money through a CSO will commit putting a certain percentage of future revenue into a reserve for a set period of time. Investors can buy claims to the reserves using ERC-20 tokens. Once the company decides to end the CSO, it is required to buy back all the outstanding tokens at the price paid for the final token minted. Fairmint believes CSOs can replace ICOs and traditional venture capital. The first CSO is being launched on Feb 19th, and Fairmint itself will be the token issuer. Fairmint raised $1.2M in a pre-seed round last year. [Link](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/55189/defi-startup-launches-platform-that-lets-people-invest-in-startup-revenue-instead-of-equity).   
  
\- US Fed governor Lael Brainard said the US Central Bank is researching blockchain tech and the use of digital currencies, including the potential for issuing its own digital currency.

\- SEC commissioner Hester Peirce proposed a three-year safe harbor period for crypto startups looking to issue tokens. Companies would have three years from their initial token sale before the SEC determines whether they need to comply with the agency's securities laws. If a protocol becomes decentralized enough, the SEC would consider it to not be a security. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-blockress-2020-02-06).
