**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- Financial regulators in China appear to be cracking down on crypto trading again, just weeks after President Xi Jinping publicly announced China's interest in blockchain technology. Regulators are targeting businesses that conduct crypto trading, token sales, or facilitate token distributions from overseas ICOs. These businesses will likely be required to shut down. China's social media platform Weibo also banned users from publishing any posts that contain "blockchain" and "crypto trading". China banned all crypto exchanges and ICOs in 2017. [Link](https://www.coindesk.com/china-is-poised-for-another-crypto-trading-crackdown-as-speculation-returns).   
  
\- Crypto exchanges around the world have been experiencing a steady decline in traffic since June, suggesting declining interest from retail investors. The Block analyzed 37 crypto exchanges and found that monthly traffic declined by 37 percent from June to September. The decline in traffic also coincided with lower traded volumes on those exchanges. [Link](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/46235/crypto-exchanges-experiencing-a-steady-drop-in-traffic-since-june-suggesting-declining-retail-interest).   
  
\- Arweave, a blockchain protocol focused on storing internet information permanently, secured $5 million in seed funding from Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures, and Multicoin Capital. Arweave's platform allows internet users to permanently record digital files such as webpages, emails, and social media posts on its blockchain through its browser extension. Over 40,000 objects were stored and over 100 apps have been built on the Arweave mainnet since the platform launched last June. [Link](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/45935/andreessen-horowitz-leads-5m-round-in-blockchain-based-internet-archive).   
  
\- Coinbase Custody announced staking services for all US customers, starting with Tezos. Customers holding any Tezos on the exchange are eligible to receive staking rewards of approximately 5 percent. Previously the staking service was available only to institutional clients. Coinbase reportedly has plans to expand its staking rewards beyond Tezos to other proof-of-stake systems. [Link](https://blog.coinbase.com/introducing-staking-rewards-on-coinbase-c394392a70eb).   
  
\- A new report from Chainalysis shows that BitForex exchange could be faking its bitcoin trading volume. For every one bitcoin recorded entering the exchange between January and November, BitForex claimed 40,000 bitcoins traded. By comparison, other exchanges typically see 6 bitcoins traded for every 1 bitcoin that enters their platform. Exchanges have been accused of overinflating volume and popularity in order to attract new traders; typically the higher an exchange is ranked the more visible they are to customers, similar to SEO rankings. [Link](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/fake-trade-volume-cryptocurrency-exchanges). [Link](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/fake-trade-volume-cryptocurrency-exchanges).

According to a job posting the central bank is hiring a manger to oversee its traditional payments division, as well as research digital currencies, stablecoins, distributed ledger technology, and digital innovation in retail payments.
