**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- Bitcoin rose above $25,000 this week, driven partially by demand in ordinals, non-fungible tokens that exist on the bitcoin blockchain. In December, Bitcoin engineer Casey Rodarmor invented an algorithm to inscribe NFT data on a satoshi, the smallest unit of bitcoin. [Link](https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/02/17/ordinals-bitcoin-25k-satoshi-explanation/).   
  
\- The SEC has charged Terraform Labs and its CEO, Do Kwon, for securities fraud related to its UST stablecoin and its LUNA tokens. [Link](https://decrypt.co/121575/sec-files-lawsuit-against-terraform-labs-and-founder-do-kwon).   
  
\- The SEC complaint against Terraform Labs said that a third party purchased more than 62 million UST to help the stablecoin maintain its $1.00 peg. The third party was repaid in the form of LUNA tokens, which it received at a price of 40 cents even though the token was trading at $90 on the open market. The SEC alleges that the third party made $1.28 billion in profits on the trade. The SEC did not reveal the identity of the third party, though many speculate it was Jump Capital.

\- The Bank of Japan will launch a new pilot program for its CBDC in April that will involve “simulated transactions.” 114 central banks, or 58% of all countries, are exploring CBDCs. [Link](https://decrypt.co/121584/japan-announces-launch-new-cbdc-pilot-april).   
  
\- Crypto-related crimes hit an all-time high of $20.6 billion in 2022, with 82.1% of all stolen funds coming from DeFi protocols, according to a Chainalysis report.
