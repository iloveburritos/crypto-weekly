\- An investigative report published by Breaker found that many crypto news outlets would accept cash in order to cover crypto projects, without disclosing the payment or labeling the article as 'sponsored content'. Reporter Corin Faife created a fake profile and reached out to 28 crypto news sites regarding paid coverage. Of the 22 sites that responded, 12 were willing to publish paid content without disclosing it as such. The prices quoted ranged from a low of $240 to high of $4,500, which reflected the size and reach of the outlets. NewsBTC and Bitcoinist were among the sites offering to publish paid content; both are high traffic sites and regularly rank in the top Google results as news sources when searching for content related to bitcoin and cryptocurrency.
