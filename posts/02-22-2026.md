**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**
\- The SEC issued guidance allowing broker-dealers to apply a 2% haircut, rather than 100%, on stablecoin values when calculating net capital, putting stablecoins on par with money market funds. [Link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonyaevans/2026/02/19/the-secs-2-haircut-on-stablecoins-is-a-bigger-deal-than-it-sounds/). [Guidance](https://www.sec.gov/rules-regulations/staff-guidance/trading-markets-frequently-asked-questions/frequently-asked-questions-relating-crypto-asset-activities-distributed-ledger-technology). [Statement](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-stablecoin-021926-cutting-two-would-do).

\- The Coinbase-incubated Ethereum Layer 2 network, Base, is moving away from Optimism's Superchain ecosystem to a "unified, Base-operated stack" to reduce coordination overhead and speed up upgrades. [Link](https://unchainedcrypto.com/coinbases-base-shifts-away-from-op-stack-in-major-layer-2-strategy-pivot/).

\- Ethereum developers plan to include the Fork-Choice Enforced Inclusion Lists (FOCIL) mechanism in the Glamsterdam hard fork scheduled for late 2026. FOCIL, entered as EIP-7805, ensures Ethereum remains censorship resistant by forcing validators to include all transactions in blocks via fork-choice rules and inclusion lists. Critics argue FOCIL could create legal liabilities for Ethereum validators, as it would force the chain to include transactions that may violate OFAC sanctions.
