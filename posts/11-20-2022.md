**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- Total market capitalization of digital assets briefly fell below $800 billion, a level not seen since early 2021. [Link](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/17/ftx-collapse-leaves-total-crypto-market-cap-under-800b-close-to-2022-low/).   
  
\- Decentralized exchange Uniswap overtook Coinbase as the second largest exchange for trading Ethereum this past week. Binance was the largest with $1.9 billion of volumes, followed by Uniswap at $1.1 billion and Coinbase at $0.6 billion. [Link](https://decrypt.co/114665/uniswap-overtakes-coinbase-second-largest-exchange-trading-ethereum-today). [Tweet](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1592188164218707969).  
  
\- Roughly 2.3 million US taxpayers traded cryptocurrencies in 2020 according to IRS data, a 149% increase from 2019 when there were nearly 1 million crypto users. [Link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-18/crypto-traders-in-us-surged-149-to-2-3-million-as-pandemic-hit).

\- The FTX fallout spread to Genesis, the crypto prime broker owned by Digital Currency Group (DCG). Genesis halted withdrawals after facing a liquidity crunch, and is reportedly seeking to raise $1 billion. Genesis had $175 million deposited on FTX when the exchange filed for bankruptcy, and earlier this year it had lent $2.3 billion to the now defunct 3AC. The significant capital infusion being sought has led the market to speculate that parent co DCG will sell other assets it owns to pay its outstanding debt, such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.

\- Shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the world’s largest publicly traded crypto fund, are trading at a new record discount of 43% relative to the price of bitcoin. Grayscale is owned and managed by DCG, which investors fear may be suffering a significant financial impact from the FTX collapse. Grayscale assured investors it was fine, but would not share proof of reserves of its funds.

Ledger saw their biggest day of sales ever this week. [Link](https://decrypt.co/114687/crypto-cold-wallets-in-ledger-trezor-sales-moon-after-ftx-collapse).  
  
\- New filings from FTX’s bankruptcy lawyers claim the exchange lacked corporate controls and that its financial statements were untrustworthy. The exchange had virtually no accounting practice or governance, and power was concentrated in the hands of a few individuals. The report shows that the exchanges private keys were shared via an unsecured group email account. [Link](https://www.axios.com/2022/11/18/ftx-bankruptcy-john-ray-sbf).

\- Shortly after filing for bankruptcy, SBF corresponded with a Vox reporter over Twitter DMs and said he regretted filing for chapter 11.
