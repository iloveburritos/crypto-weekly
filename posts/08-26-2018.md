**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**
\- Chinese mobile payment platforms WeChat Pay and Alipay announced they would work with government agencies closely to monitor crypto transactions. The announcement came just days after five high-level regulatory agencies in China - including the People's Bank of China and the Banking Regulatory Commission - issued a warning against any crypto-related fundraising and trading activities. Tencent, the parent company of WeChat Pay, announced it would prohibit users from using WeChat payments to make any virtual currency-related transactions.

\- Bitmain, the crypto mining giant, may be losing its technology edge according to Sanford Bernstein. Bitmain may need to write down the value of its inventory as makers of rival mining gear catch up. Bitmain continues to control 85 percent of the market for crypto mining chips, but is facing growing competition from players globally.

\- Serial founder Alex Adelman recently launched Lolli, a rewards platform that offers users BTC when they shop at participating online retailers. Consumers install a browser extension to discover retailers offering crypto rewards. Lolli is very similar to another recently launched loyalty app called Bumped; instead of handing out BTC, Bumped hands out microshares of the stock of the company the consumer just shopped at.
