Going to start this newsletter off a little differently this week. [ENS Domains](https://ens.domains/) is holding its $ENS token launch on 11/8 and is accepting applications for DAO delegates who can participate in governance. For those who don't know, I'm a huge believer in ENS and believe it represents the best of crypto: identity, community, self-expression and utility all in one.   
  
I have applied to be an ENS delegate ([app here](https://t.co/0A2AFkM7UP?amp=1)). Token holders have the option of selecting a delegate when they claim their tokens any time after 11/8. **Please select me** (**maaria.eth) to be your delegate. Read more about it [here](https://twitter.com/maariabajwa/status/1457413637304324097?s=20).**

**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- The US House voted to pass an infrastructure bill that contains controversial crypto tax implications. The bill expands the definition of a broker, which would require more crypto startups to report transactions. The bill also amends a 40 year old law that requires detailed information on cash transactions over $10,000, including the sender's personal information, social security number, and nature of the transaction. Previously the law only applied to in-person cash transactions, but it may now apply to cryptocurrencies and digital assets like NFTs as well, making the law nearly impossible to comply with.

\- The Ethereum Name Service (ENS), an Ethereum-based, open-source protocol for domain names, announced it was decentralizing its governance process through the use of delegates and a dedicated $ENS token. The DAO delegates will participate in governance over the existing ENS treasury, future funds, pricing, and registration for .ETH names. A snapshot of ENS domain holders was taken on 10/31, and users will be able to claim their tokens starting 11/8. Users can select a delegate when claiming their tokens.

\- There have been 70 DeFi attacks this year totaling around $1.4 billion stolen, though $760 million has been returned. Majority of the exploits happened on Ethereum (34), followed by Binance Smart Chain (25). 34 of the attacks employed flash loans, meaning loans were taken out, used for some function, and repaid all in the same transaction block. Big losses include Compound, which had a bug in an update that led to $114 million in COMP tokens being misallocated (half was returned), and Cream Finance, which was exploited for $130 million using a large flash loan.
