**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

The market cap for the entire crypto industry has also passed $1 trillion for the first time in history. [Link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cryptoconfidential/2021/01/09/bitcoin-surges-past-40000--crypto-exceeds-1-trillion-market-cap/). Growing interest from wealthy investors and accredited institutions is said to be driving the price increase. [Link](https://dailyhodl.com/2021/01/06/ubs-wealth-manager-says-large-institutional-buyers-quietly-fueling-bitcoin-boom/).   
  
\- The US Office of the Currency Comptroller is granting banks the ability to transact in stablecoins and use the tech in a similar way they use SWIFT and FedWire system. The announcement also paved the way for banks to use non-stablecoin currencies like bitcoin. [Link](https://www.cryptovantage.com/news/banks-get-greenlight-to-use-stablecoins-bitcoin-for-payment-processing/). [Link](https://www.publish0x.com/crypto-awareness/us-govt-gives-banks-the-go-ahead-to-transact-w-stablecoins-a-xgplwdg). The UK government also released a paper signifying the role stablecoins could play in retail and cross-border payments (including settlements). [Link](https://www.bitreporter.com/stablecoin/the-uk-embraces-stablecoins/).   
  
\- FinCEN, a bureau of the US Treasury Department, proposed new rules that would subject all wallets, including self-hosted or non-custodial wallets, to KYC and reporting requirements for transactions above $3,000. Exchanges would also need to submit records involving transactions worth more than $10,000 in a given reporting period. Coinbase, A16z, and others said they intend to challenge these rules in court if they pass. [Link](https://www.theblock.co/post/90091/a16z-coinbase-intend-challenge-fincen-proposed-crypto-wallet-rules-court-should-become-law).   
  
\- Network fees on Ethereum have climbed to over $17 per transaction, an all-time high in average network fees. Yield chasing on numerous DeFi platforms also contributed to the fee increases. [Link](https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2021/01/ethereum-fees-almost-doubled-on-the-network-hitting-a-new-all-time-high).   
  
\- The SEC is alleging that Ripple sold its cryptocurrency XRP as an unregistered security.

Tetragon, the lead investor of Ripple's $200 million Series C round, sued the company and wants to redeem its Series C shares. It also wants to block Ripple from using any cash or other liquid assets until it is repaid. [Link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-05/ripple-investor-sues-to-force-stock-redemption-after-sec-claim).

\- Investor Chamath Palihapitiya says that bitcoin is a hedge against global uncertainty, especially because the asset is largely untied to governmental authority or central banking monetary policy. He thinks Bitcoin is likely to reach $200,000 at some point. [Link](https://cointelegraph.com/news/chamath-palihapitiya-sees-bitcoin-as-insurance-against-uncertainty).
