**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- The NFL and Dapper Labs are partnering on an NFT marketplace for the NFL similar to NBA Top Shots. The NFL will acquire equity in Dapper Labs. The marketplace is expected to go live in early January 2022. [Link](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/118953/nfl-and-dapper-labs-plan-to-launch-an-american-football-focused-nft-market-report).   
  
\- Ethereum researcher Virgil Griffith plead guilty to violating US sanctions laws. Griffith was arrested after giving a talk in North Korea on blockchain and cryptocurrencies in 2017. Griffith's plea deal means he will spend a maximum of 6.5 years in prison. [Link](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/118785/ethereum-researcher-virgil-griffith-pleads-guilty-to-sanctions-violations).   
  
\- Bitcoin Lightning Network has reached all-time high network capacity, nearing 3,000 bitcoin (over $120 million). This capacity is the amount that users can move (send and receive) via the network. [Link](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/119025/bitcoin-lightning-network-capacity-reaches-all-time-high).   
  
\- A new upgrade to Compound Finance contained a bug that allowed some users to claim as much as 168,000 COMP tokens, worth around $50 million. The purpose of the upgrade was to split the COMP distribution to liquidity suppliers and borrowers based on governance-set ratios instead of the previous 50/50 share model. Given the decentralized governance of compound, there are no admin controls or community tools to disable the COMP distribution. Any changes to the protocol require a 7-day governance process to make their way into production. [Link](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/119086/compound-bug-comp-risk-misreward). [R Leshner Tweets](https://twitter.com/rleshner/status/1443380518498848768). It appears as though all 280,000 COMP tokens (roughly $80 million) in the Comptroller Contract have now been drained. Leshner threatened to report the distributions as income to the IRS if the funds weren't returned.
