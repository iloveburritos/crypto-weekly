**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- The price of ETH rallied over 12% on the news that the upcoming Merge was tentatively planned for September. Ethereum's Merge will switch the protocol from the energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanism to the more energy-efficient proof of stake system. Miners will be replaced with "validators" who can stake 32 ETH with the network for the chance to add blocks and earn fees. Ethereum rallied on the news.

\- After 8 years, creditors of failed bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox are close to seeing their money again. Creditors are able to choose between receiving a mix of BTC, bitcoin cash and yen or cash. The liquidations will come from the roughly 141k bitcoin and 70B yen held by Mt. Gox after it was hacked for 850,000 BTC. Worst case scenario is 100% of creditors opt for cash payouts, and the trustee sells 141k BTC at once which would represent 8.8% of total daily exchange volume.
