**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- The CFPB announced a new rule that would allow it to regulate digital asset wallets as financial institutions offering electronic funds transfers, including self-custodied wallets. This interpretation would allow the CFPB to hold wallet providers like MetaMask and Phantom responsible for fraudulent and “unauthorized” transactions. The proposed rule is open to two months of public comments. [Link](https://decrypt.co/300424/biden-cfpb-crypto-wallet-metamask-phantom). [Tweet](https://x.com/billhughesdc/status/1877740571831193697). [Proposal](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_efta-proposed-interpretive-rule_2025-01.pdf).

\- A New York district court judge granted a rare interlocutory appeal to Coinbase in its ongoing case with the SEC. Coinbase claimed substantial grounds for differences of opinions on how the Howey Test applies to crypto. The lawsuit will be paused while the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reviews the appeal. The SEC sued Coinbase in 2023 for allegedly operating as an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency.
