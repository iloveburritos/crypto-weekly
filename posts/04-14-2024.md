**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- Bitcoin saw about $780 million in liquidations over 24 hours and a 7.5% decline, the largest drop in a month. The selloff occurred on the back of high inflation data that pushed rate cut expectations out to September, as well as news of an impending Iranian attack against Israel. Ethereum was down as much as 12% at one point, the largest intraday decline since November 2022.
