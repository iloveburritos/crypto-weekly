**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

**[Maaria Note]** **The dramatic collapse of crypto exchange FTX this week shocked the entire crypto community including myself. The second and third order effects of the exchange’s collapse are likely to affect the entire crypto ecosystem, from regulations to venture funding to mainstream crypto adoption. In my opinion, the events of this week highlight the problems with having trusted, centralized intermediaries in our financial system. A lot happened this week, so crypto weekly has a different format than usual.**  
  
  
*TL;DR: FTX, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, filed for bankruptcy this week after losing over $10 billion of customer deposits. FTX’s founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is said to have sent customer deposits to its trading partner, Alameda Research, which had suffered significant losses earlier this year in the wake of the Luna / Terra / 3AC market crash. The scheme unraveled this week when the exchange was unable to fulfill $6 billion in withdrawal requests due to insufficient liquidity. Bankman-Fried had reportedly built a ‘back-door’ in the exchange that allowed him to transfer assets between FTX and Alameda without raising red flags. FTX was a crypto behemoth before this week: it was valued at $32 billion in January 2022 and Bankman-Fried was well-known for his lobbying efforts with regulators and lawmakers. The dramatic collapse of the exchange wiped roughly $200 billion from the crypto markets.*  
  
  
**The Players:**  
“SBF” = Sam Bankman-Fried. Founder and CEO of crypto exchange FTX. Also founder of Alameda Research.  
  
Alameda = A hedge fund and market maker. Founded by SBF and led by Caroline Ellis. Viewed by many as the unofficial trading arm of FTX.  
  
FTX = crypto exchange founded by SBF. FTX operated 2 exchanges: FTX and FTX US. FTX Global was incorporated in the Bahamas and did not have the same regulatory oversight as FTX US.   
  
Binance = world’s largest crypto exchange founded by "CZ".   
  
“CZ” = Changpeng Zhao. Founder and CEO of Binance.   
  
FTT = token issued by FTX that offers holders discounts on FTX trading fees among other perks. It is not backed or collateralized by any assets. 

**Part 1: Alameda’s Balance Sheet**  
\- Coindesk reported that SBF’s trading firm Alameda Research held 40% of its $15 billion of assets in FTX’s native token FTT, a free floating token issued by FTX.  
  
\- The report also indicated that Alameda held $8 billion of liabilities, drawing concerns of a potential asset - liability mismatch given their significant FTT holdings and the token’s low float at the time. [Coindesk article](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/02/divisions-in-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-blur-on-his-trading-titan-alamedas-balance-sheet/).   
  
\- Alameda alleged there were $10 billion of assets off balance-sheet that were not reported, but failed to give more transparency. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/carolinecapital/status/1589264375042707458?s=20&t=nztNilNgCKMfGj51X9D3YA). 

**Part 2: CZ vs SBF**  
\- Binance CEO CZ then announced plans to liquidate $2 billion FTT tokens “due to recent revelations that have come to light”. Binance had received the FTT tokens in exchange for divesting its equity interest in FTX in 2021. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1589283421704290306). [The Block.](https://www.theblock.co/post/183570/binance-to-sell-ftx-token-holdings-alameda-ceo-says-leaked-balance-sheet-is-incomplete) [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2022/11/12/sbf-vs-cz-ftx-binance-crypto-billionaires-social-media-bloodsport-32-billion-blowup/).   
  
\- FTT fell from ~$25 to $23 on the news, causing Alameda CEO Caroline Ellis to publicly offer to buy Binance’s FTT tokens at $22. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/carolinecapital/status/1589287457975304193). CZ refused, causing FTT to fall below $5, wiping out more than $2 billion in market cap value in a day. [CZ Tweet](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1589703098762940416). [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/08/ftxs-ftt-token-plunges-80percent-wiping-out-over-2-billion-in-value.html).

\- FTX received $6 billion in withdrawal requests over 72 hours as the FTT price crash exacerbated fears over Alameda’s insolvency and its close ties to the exchange.

[The Block](https://decrypt.co/114052/binance-cancels-plans-acquire-ftx).   
  
\- SBF assured the market that FTX assets were fine despite the FTT sell-off. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/fintwit_news/status/1590451117535920128?s=20&t=zRtSLFzfWkSpHd5BoLxKwA).   
  
\- FTX Global halted withdrawals the next morning and announced that Binance had signed a non-binding LOI to acquire the exchange and help with the liquidity crisis. The deal excluded FTX US. [SBF Tweet](https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1590012124864348160?s=20&t=zRtSLFzfWkSpHd5BoLxKwA). [CZ Tweet](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1590013613586411520?s=20&t=NX6rKH8AZ36udDhN3Xoo4A).   
  
\- Binance pulled out of the deal within 24 hours, citing FTX’s mishandling of customer funds and regulatory concerns. [Binance Tweet](https://twitter.com/binance/status/1590449161069268992?s=20&t=zRtSLFzfWkSpHd5BoLxKwA). [Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/114052/binance-cancels-plans-acquire-ftx).

[Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/114094/ftx-chief-used-client-funds-ftt-tokens-robinhood-shares-prop-up-alameda-research-report).  
  
\- SBF reportedly built a “backdoor” to the FTX exchange to change financial records and move funds without alerting others. This allowed him to move $10 billion of assets to Alameda without raising any alarms. Only a handful of FTX employees were aware of the arrangement.

**Part 4: FTX gets hacked**- Following the bankruptcy filing, more than $600 million of crypto assets were drained from FTX and Alameda wallets on Friday night. Over $470 million is suspected to have been stolen by a bad actor, while the remainder was moved to consolidate assets for the bankruptcy proceedings.
