**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

There is now only the Goerli testnet left to be merged in the coming weeks. [Link](https://www.theblock.co/post/156013/ethereum-developers-activate-the-merge-on-sepolia-testnet). [Link](https://decrypt.co/104513/ethereum-merge-moves-closer-sepolia-testnet).   
  
\- Reddit plans to release "Collectible Avatars" in the coming weeks that will come with unique benefits such as the ability to mix-and-match avatar gear with other accessories, and having a glow-like effect to their profile image.

[Link](https://www.theblock.co/post/156031/uprise-lost-99-of-client-funds-while-shorting-luna-during-its-price-crash).

The broker has between $1 billion and $10 billion in assets and more than 100,000 creditors and owes $75 million to Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research and $960 million to Google. It did not name other firms to whom it owes money. [Link](https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/06/crypto-broker-voyager-digital-files-for-bankruptcy/).
