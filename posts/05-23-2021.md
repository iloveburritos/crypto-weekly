**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- China's State Council, the country's central government body, said it would be "cracking down on bitcoin mining and trading activities" as part of its efforts to prevent financial risks. Local traders and miners liquidated their cryptocurrency holdings for fiat, which led to a sharp decline in the price of cryptocurrencies. The announcement came after President Xi Jingping said China would be stepping up efforts to achieve carbon neutrality. The inner Mongolia government operates on coal-based energy, and has already started to drive out bitcoin mining operations. It has even set up a dedicated hotline for its constituents to report on active bitcoin mining farms. [Link](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/105708/china-bitcoin-crackdown-usdt-otc). [Link](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-03/16/c_139814792.htm).
