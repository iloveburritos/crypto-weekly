**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- Many analysts and traders in crypto have debated whether bitcoin should trade as a hedge against bearishness in traditional markets or if it's more vulnerable to a sell-off alongside risky assets in down markets. The recent coronavirus outbreak has led to a significant decline in cryptocurrency prices; some analysts believe the sharp decline is driven by investors who are indiscriminately selling all assets perceived as risky, including cryptocurrencies. Crypto enthusiasts are optimistic that investors will soon increase their allocations to cryptocurrencies, as interest rates are falling and investors are looking to diversify to assets uncorrelated with yields such as gold, artwork, and cryptocurrencies. [Link](https://www.coindesk.com/as-fed-contemplates-coronavirus-prompted-easing-bitcoin-traders-bet-on-halving).   
  
\- DeFi apps now have to deal with flash loans. Recently, two hackers used flash loans to attack the margin trading protocol bZx, taking $950,000 across two transactions. Attackers instantaneously borrowed hundreds of thousands of dollars of ETH, threaded it through a chain of vulnerable on-chain protocols, extracted hundreds of thousands in stolen assets, and then paid back their massive ETH loans - all in a single ethereum transaction. Flash loans occur instantaneously in a single transaction, unlike traditional smart-contract platforms which process transactions one at a time. While flash loans are interesting because lenders no longer have to assume risk (they're paid back instantaneously at the end of the transaction), flash loans make the network overall more susceptible to hacking. [Link](https://www.coindesk.com/the-defi-flash-loan-attack-that-changed-everything).   
  
\- Crypto prime broker Tagomi is joining the Libra Association, making it the 22nd member of the project.
