**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- The CFTC filed a lawsuit against a DAO for its involvement with the bZeroX protocol. The SEC had settled charges with the founders of the protocol for “illegally offering leveraged and margined retail commodity transactions in digital assets,” as well as failing to KYC it’s customers. The CFTC alleges that the DAO violated the same laws. A dissenting CFTC commissioner called the action “blatant regulation by enforcement” and said it fails to “rely on the legal authority” of the Commission’s mandate.
