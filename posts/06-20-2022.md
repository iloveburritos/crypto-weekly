\- Celsius Network, which amassed more than $20 billion in assets by promising interest rates as high as 18% on crypto deposits, paused withdrawals this week citing marketing conditions.

\- Play-to-earn platform Merit Circle will pay $1.75 million to Yield Guild Games (YGG) as a settlement after Merit Circle's DAO voted to remove YGG as an investor.

\- Users of Solend, a decentralized lending protocol on Solana, granted emergency powers to the protocol to take over a whale's account, which was at risk of liquidation putting the protocol at risk. The proposal would have allowed Solend to liquidate the whale's assets via “over-the-counter” transactions, as opposed to on-exchange trades. The account concerned had deposited 5.7 million SOL tokens into Solend, accounting for more than 95% of deposits. Against that, it was borrowing $108 million in the stablecoins USDC and ether. By Monday users overturned the initial vote. [Link](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/20/users-of-defi-app-solend-block-attempt-to-take-over-whale-account.html).

Testing issues could delay the merge. [Link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-16/token-at-the-center-of-crypto-storm-becomes-arbitrage-target).
