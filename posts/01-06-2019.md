**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- PayPal announced it was withdrawing from the Libra Association, weeks ahead of an Oct. 14 meeting where the 27 other launch partners of Libra are expected to sign a charter formally creating the Libra governance council. The news come days after a Bloomberg report that global payments companies Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, and Stripe were all hesitating to officially commit to the project amid ongoing regulatory concerns. [Link](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/4/20899310/facebook-libra-paypal-online-currency-payment-system-cryptocurrency). [Bloomberg Link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-01/facebook-libra-payments-partners-waver-on-cryptocurrency-support).

\- Coinbase is in early acquihire talks with Omni, the physical storage-turned-rentals startup. Coinbase would acquire Omni's engineering staff and have them work on Coinbase Earn.

\- On October 1, the SEC published a letter stating that bitcoin isn't a security. This was the first confirmation of the position following the framework released by the SEC earlier this year.

Tether is frequently used by crypto exchanges, many of which still don't have bank accounts and can't hold dollars on behalf of their customers. [Link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-01/tether-not-bitcoin-likely-the-world-s-most-used-cryptocurrency).

\- SegWit transactions on BItcoin have risen sharply in recent weeks, jumping up to about 55 percent in September from below 45 percent months ago.

Earlier this week, Binance CEO indicated that the crypto exchange could add SegWit support to its platform by the end of Q1 2020. [Link](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/42041/segwit-transactions-on-bitcoin-network-have-risen-sharply-in-september).
