**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- BlackRock refiled its application for a Bitcoin spot ETF, after the SEC had called its original filing "inadequate" for failing to address the agency's concern over market manipulation and failing to name its partner exchange. In its new filing BlackRock indicated that Coinbase would provide market surveillance and exchange services. [Link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-03/blackrock-s-bitcoin-etf-application-is-refiled-by-nasdaq-to-sec#xj4y7vzkg).

\- Scaling blockchain Polygon released a new zero-knowledge architecture called Polygon 2.0 which creates a coordination layer for cross-chain transactions powered by zero-knowledge proofs.
