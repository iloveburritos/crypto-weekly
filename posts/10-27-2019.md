**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- China's President, Xi Jinping, said the country needs to "seize the opportunity" afforded by blockchain technology. He said blockchain tech has a wide array of applications within China ranging from financing businesses to mass transit to poverty alleviation. Xi said it would be necessary to implement the rule of law network into existing and future blockchain systems, arguing for top-down guidance and regulation. He also called for the creation of "Blockchain +", a platform alluding to personal development such as education, employment and food and medicinal safety, among other basic needs. The People's Bank of China banned cryptocurrencies in 2017, although a digital renminbi is being developed by the central bank and is likely to launch soon. Cryptocurrencies rose on the news that China would increase investment and accelerate the development of blockchain tech. [Link](https://www.coindesk.com/president-xi-says-china-should-seize-opportunity-to-adopt-blockchain).   
  
\- Libra is reportedly reconsidering pegging its token to a basket of currencies, after coming under intense scrutiny from regulators who worry the creation of a new synthetic global currency could upend the global financial system. Libra is now considering launching a series of stablecoins, including a dollar stablecoin, a euro stablecoin, etc. The project is still aiming for a June 2020 launch but could miss that target due to regulatory hurdles. [Link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-imf-worldbank-facebook-idUSKBN1WZ0NX).

\- Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in front of Congress last week, and covered a wide range of topics including its upcoming cryptocurrency Libra. Zuckerberg claimed that China will soon have its own version of Libra, so regulators shouldn't block the project. He also said he is open to regulators requiring Libra to be majority-backed by the US dollar and that he would leave inheritance to his children in Libra. Most notably he mentioned that Libra would build strong AML features into Libra's network, but would not commit to blocking anonymous wallets. [Link](https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/23/zuckerberg-testimony/).
