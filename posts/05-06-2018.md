\- City council officials in Berkeley unanimously vote to explore the perks of using an ICO to raise funds in lieu of a conventional municipal bond offering.

\- The SEC is considering whether Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, should be classified as a security. The SEC is focusing on the fact that ether was originally sold through a resale in 2014, unlike bitcoin which has been mined since inception. Recently, prominent venture capital firms and lawyers met with SEC officials in a bid to convince the agency to provide formal guidance that ether and certain ICOs are not securities.
