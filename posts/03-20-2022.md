**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

[NOTE:  This week includes some conflicts that I feel I need to disclose. To level set, I started this newsletter back in 2017 for myself and my team as a way to keep up with the happenings in crypto. For a long time I knew every subscriber personally but as this newsletter has grown organically to a few thousand subscribers, I realize that not everyone knows me or what I do. SO, to that end, I am a board member of the Ape Foundation, co-founder of Sixth Wall, and investor at Sound Ventures. All are included in this week's announcements]  
  
\- $APE launched this week, as the utility and governance token adopted by the Ape Foundation. The DAO's primary purpose is to "steward the growth and development of the APE ecosystem in a fair and inclusive way". Holders of Bored Ape Yacht Club and Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFTs were able to claim $APE and will be able to participate in governance of the foundation. There are currently 5 active DAO proposals that $APE holders can vote on. The foundation appointed 5 board members to provide oversite in the first 6 months, after which the foundation and DAO participants will vote in a board. [Link](https://fortune.com/2022/03/17/nft-bored-ape-yacht-club-dropped-token/). [Twitter Spaces with the DAO board](https://twitter.com/apecoin/status/1504546374641238016).   
  
\- Yuga Labs, the creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection, dropped a teaser trailer for a new project called Otherside.

\- Sixth Wall and animation studio Toonstar are releasing The Gimmicks next week, a new animated web series on Solana. The show has created a 10k NFT collection that it is giving its users for free. NFT holders get early access to watch the episodes and will use their NFTs to vote on storyline and character arcs after every episode. New episodes will be released every other week. [Link](https://decrypt.co/94992/mila-kunis-studio-launches-solana-nft-animated-series-gimmicks).

\- Crypto analytics company Nansen released six new indices for tracking the NFT market, segmenting the market into the "NFT 500" (akin to the S&P 500), the "Blue Chip-10" index (the 10 biggest notable and classic NFT collection by market cap), the "Social-100" (includes pfp NFTs), and others around "Art", "Social", and "Metaverse". The data shows that NFTs are +90.9% YTD when denominated in ETH, and 36% when denominated in USD. This is despite a strong pullback in the broader crypto markets and ETH -24% YTD. Historical data shows that NFTs have a negative correlation with crypto assets (when denominated in crypto), and positive correlation when denominated in USD. [Link](https://www.nansen.ai/post/nansen-nft-indexes-a-new-way-to-invest-in-nfts). [Link](https://decrypt.co/95139/ethereum-nft-inversely-correlated-crypto-market-nansen).
