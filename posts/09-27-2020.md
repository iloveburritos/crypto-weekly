**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- Crypto exchange Gemini added 15 DeFi tokens for trading, including Uniswap (UNI), Yearn.finance (YFI), Balancer (BAL), Curve (CRV), and Ren Network (REN). [Link](https://decrypt.co/42955/gemini-adds-uniswaps-uni-and-14-other-defi-tokens).   
  
\- Average Ethereum fees fell this week, hitting less than $2.30 per transaction after hitting an all-time high of $14.6 on September 2. [Link](https://decrypt.co/43055/ethereum-transaction-fees-fall-to-lowest-in-49-days-as-defi-craze-subsides).   
  
\- Mask Network has launched a widget allowing Twitter users to access market data and trade on Uniswap without leaving the platform. [Link](https://cointelegraph.com/news/you-can-now-trade-on-uniswap-without-leaving-twitter).   
  
\- Total value locked on Uniswap passed $1.6 billion after introducing liquidity incentives via its UNI tokens. Just two days ago TVL on Uniswap totaled less than $750 million. SushiSwap, a Uniswap clone had seen locked value rise to more than $1.4 billion after it released a governance token before Uniswap. [Link](https://decrypt.co/42339/ethereum-uniswap-soars-1-6-billion-uni-launch).   
  
\- The SEC said that broker-dealers like Coinbase can swap between digital securities on behalf of customers in a 3-step process: clients authorize trades at specific price and amount, broker-dealer custodian executes the trades, and then inform the client after the fact. This makes it easier for customers to swap digital assets. Previously customers would submit trades then wait for an exchange to find a counterparty on behalf of the dealer; once the counterparty was identified, the broker-dealer had to confirm the request again before executing the final transaction. [Link](https://decrypt.co/43037/the-sec-just-reduced-risk-for-broker-dealers-like-coinbase).   
  
\- Coinbase said it would soon list UNI, the native token of decentralized exchange Uniswap, on Coinbase Pro. The news came hours after Uniswap airdropped its tokens to everyone who used its platform prior to Sept 1, including liquidity providers and casual traders. The minimum 400 UNI drop was worth almost $3,500 at its peak. It's currently worth $200. [Link](https://decrypt.co/42110/coinbase-lists-uniswap-token-hours-after-1500-airdrop).   
  
\- Crypto custody service Anchorage now supports custody of 5 new DeFi governance tokens: Uniswap (UNI), Aave (AAVE), Balancer (BAL), Nexus Mutual (NXM), and Yearn Finance (YFI). [Link](https://decrypt.co/42862/visa-backed-anchorage-loads-up-on-uniswap-defi-tokens).   
  
\- Uniswap, Aave, and Synthetix are all close to rolling out Layer 2 scaling solutions. The move should reduce gas and transactions fees on the Ethereum protocol, which have surged in recent months as DeFi has taken off. [Link](https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-projects-rush-towards-layer-2-as-ethereum-clogs-up).  
  
\- Morgan Beller, co-creator of Libra, left Facebook to become a general partner at venture firm NFX. [Link](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/morgan-beller-co-creator-of-the-libra-digital-currency-just-joined-the-venture-firm-nfx/).
