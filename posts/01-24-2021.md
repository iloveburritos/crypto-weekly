**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- During her confirmation hearing for Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen testified that many of the transactions happening with bitcoin are illegal, illicit transactions and that it was 'not a stable store of value and doesn't constitute legal tender'. In a subsequent written statement Yellen clarified that crypto has the potential to improve the financial system, but can also be used to finance terrorism, facilitate money laundering, and support activities that might threaten US national security interests. Given the risks, she emphasized the need for effective regulation. [Link](https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2021/01/171498-dr-janet-yellens-testimony-before-the-senate-finance-committee-i-believe-the-united-states-must-be-a-leader-in-the-digital-asset-and-financial-technology-areas/).   
  
\- The number of bitcoin whales (addresses with 1,000+ bitcoin) continued to increase even after the cryptocurrency's price dropped below $30,000.
