\- Tether is not 100 percent backed by fiat reserves. The company updated the terms on its website stating that while the stablecoin is 100 percent backed, its reserves may at times include other assets besides the US dollar. Tether has come under fire over the last year over questions on whether the firm has sufficient reserves to back its 1.9 billion USDT  in circulation. Much of the controversy arises from the fact that Tether has never provided a full independent audit of its dollar collateral.

\- Coinbase Custody completed its first OTC trade directly out of cold storage. The technology gives clients immediate liquidity; previously traders would have to withdraw assets from cold storage to a hot wallet in order to execute a  trade - this would take up to 24 to 48 hours and often leading to sub optimal execution.
