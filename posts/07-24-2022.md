**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- The DoJ filed criminal charges against a former Coinbase product manager and 2 others for wire fraud. The group bought tokens based on insider knowledge of their upcoming listings on Coinbase, and are alleged to have made $1.5 million across 25 different tokens. [Link](https://www.theblock.co/post/158960/former-coinbase-product-manager-arrested-on-insider-trading-charges).

\- The SEC simultaneously filed a civil suit against the trio for insider trading. The case is being used by the SEC to formally declare 9 digital asset as securities, though it did not formally bring charges against any of the tokens. Coinbase separately filed a petition with the SEC asking for it to start a rulemaking process to detail how it would apply federal securities laws to crypto assets. In an unprecedented move the CFTC also criticized the SEC's categorization of the assets as securities.
