#### **THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- The "lightning torch," an ongoing experiment meant to showcase the power of the lightning network, was passed to Ziya Sadr in Iran despite the ongoing US sanctions.

The passing of the torch to Iran was a major milestone in the experiment, which is aimed at demonstrating bitcoin's power as a fast global payment system that can be sent anywhere.

\- A study by Cisco security researchers shows that college campuses are responsible for approximately 22 percent of cryptocurrency mining. This is likely driven by students capitalizing on the free electricity they receive in their dorms. The energy and utilities sector is the largest miner of cryptocurrencies, though the report speculates this is due to companies running old computers that can be easily infected with mining malware.

\- Coinbase's director of institutional sales justified its acquisition of Neutrino during an interview with Cheddar by saying the exchange's previous analytics provider was "selling client data to outside sources." Coinbase later said Sandler misspoke and that the exchange "never shared customers' personally identifiable information with any third-party blockchain analysis vendors." Analytics providers typically collect anonymous transaction data and commercialize access to that information for customers seeking to investigate suspicious activity. Chainalysis and Elliptic both deny receiving or selling personal identifiable information from Coinbase. [Link](https://www.coindesk.com/coinbases-reputation-crisis-crypto-client-data).
