**THIS WEEK IN CRYPTO**

\- Compound has overtaken MakerDao as the decentralized finance protocol with the most value locked. Compound has $484 million locked while MakerDAO has $481 million locked.

\- Bitcoin posted a 15% increase in mining difficulty, the largest increase in nearly 2.5 years. The increase in difficulty comes a month after the halvening, where bitcoin block rewards were reduced from 12.5 bitcoin per block to 6.25 bitcoin per block. The reduction in block rewards initially forced some miners to halt operations leading to a decline in difficulty, but that encouraged some to come back as they could now operate profitability leading to an increase in difficulty levels. [Link](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-biggest-jump-in-29-months).
